Hi there! I'm Remy, a developer with a focus on C++, C#, C, Linux and embedded systems.

I currently work for [De Jong DUKE][11] were I develop software for an
embedded platform that powers coffee machines. This is a C++ and Qt stack
running on Yocto Linux. It controls hardware, runs the UI and has a few
utilities for IoT connectivity and configuration. Technology includes
Microsoft Visual C++ (MFC), .NET (Framework, C++/CLI and Core), Flash, Qt
and ARM kernel drivers.

I've been a Linux/UNIX sysadmin for over 10 years; I've built high-available
cloud environments in OpenStack, Azure or on premise, with Ansible, Chef,
Puppet and Terraform (but can work with any other configuration management
tool). My sysadmin keywords are OpenStack, cloud, virtualization,
high-availability, scaling and clustering, security, (Open)SSL, Python,
Powershell, bash and general linux/UNIX system administration. 

I've worked in a devops role for [the Erasmus University Medical Center][3] (a
large hospital and medical university in Rotterdam), [Digidentity][4] (a Dutch
[certificate authority][5], the company that develops [DigiD][6] and other Ruby
on Rails applications), [CloudVPS][7] (an OpenStack cloud provider), 
[VolkerWessels][2] (as an Azure cloud specialist) and a few other smaller
companies. 

I design, build, document and manage large, complex and high-available systems.
I'm a team player that loves to work with configuration management tools and
version control systems. If I do something more than three times, I automate it.
**Planning, documentation, monitoring and backups are things I do first, not
when the time allows it later.** Last but not least I have an interest in legacy
systems like the PDP-11, PDP-8, OpenVMS, HP-UX and old UNIX systems.

This is my personal website, please do note that these articles do not reflect
or are based on work, opinions or policies of any of my (previous) employers.
Any resemblance to reality is pure coincidence.

This site started in 2006 as my form of (public) documentation. It has grown to
include software, guides, snippets and articles on linux/UNIX, programming, system
administration and everything related with over 10.000 unique visitors a day as
of [2018-06][9]. The URL is the phonetic way you say my name (Ray-Mii), since
non-Dutch speakers always have trouble with the correct pronunciation.

If you want to send me feedback, emails or comments, see below for the contact
details.

### Resume

If you want my full resume including all (previous) jobs, experience and
education, please send me an email.

### Contact

You can reach me by email, try mailing "contact" "at" "relst" "dot" "nl". I'm
not on any social networks, not on Facebook, not on LinkedIn, not on twitter, 
Identica, IRC, diaspora, mastodon, nowhere. Every profile on a social network 
claiming to be me is false.

In the past this page also had a GPG and S/MIME key for secure email. I removed 
that because the usage was so low compared to the maintenance efforts.
