Because of a [bug in mpd][1] which is fixed in 10-STABLE I wanted to move one of
my FreeBSD machines from 10.0-RELEASE to 10.0-STABLE. The process to do so is
fairly simple. Basically, you check out the new source code, build the world,
build the kernel, install the kernel, install the world, merge some stuff and
reboot.

Make sure you have a backup of important stuff on the system.

### Stable?

The name "-STABLE" is frequently misunderstood. It does not mean solid or
steady. -STABLE means that while code can change, the ABI (Application Binary
Interface) will remain stable and not change. Programs compiled to run on
FreeBSD 9.0-RELEASE, or 9.1-RELEASE, or 9.2-RELEASE will continue to work on
FreeBSD 9-STABLE. Effectively, -STABLE is the latest version of FreeBSD you can
get without breaking installed software. [[source]][3]

### Procedure

Move the current source code to a backup folder to be sure to get only -STABLE
code:

    
    
    mv /usr/src /usr/src-RELEASE
    

Do the same thing for the ports tree:

    
    
    mv /usr/ports /usr/ports-RELEASE
    

When I did not moved the `/usr/src` folder and continued this article, everytime
I would be back in 10.0-RELEASE...

Check out the STABLE source code:

    
    
    svn checkout https://svn0.us-west.freebsd.org/base/stable/10 /usr/src
    

Also for the ports tree:

    
    
    svn checkout https://svn0.us-west.freebsd.org/ports/head /usr/ports
    

Then cd in to the correct folder

    
    
    cd /usr/src
    

Build the world:

    
    
    make buildworld -j4
    

The `-j 4` part means that it should run 4 jobs at once. I have a quad core CPU
so all the cores will be used.

Build the kernel:

    
    
    make buildkernel KERNCONF=VPN
    make installkernel KERNCONF=VPN
    

I have a different kernel file for the VPN setup.

Now reboot in to the new kernel:

    
    
    shutdown -r now
    

Next, it was time to install the world. However, `make installworld` complained:

    
    
    make installworld
    ERROR: Required unbound user is missing, see /usr/src/UPDATING.
    *** Error code 1
    
    Stop.
    make[1]: stopped in /usr/src
    *** Error code 1
    
    Stop.
    make: stopped in /usr/src
    

`/usr/src/UPDATING` to the rescue:

    
    
    20130916:
            With the addition of unbound(8), a new unbound user is now
            required during installworld.  "mergemaster -p" can be used to
            add the user prior to installworld, as documented in the handbook.
    

However, `mergemaster -p` did not create the user:

    
    
    mergemaster -p
    
    *** Creating the temporary root environment in /var/tmp/temproot
     *** /var/tmp/temproot ready for use
     *** Creating and populating directory structure in /var/tmp/temproot
    
    
    
    *** Beginning comparison
    
     *** Temp ./etc/group and installed have the same Id, deleting
     *** Temp ./etc/master.passwd and installed have the same Id, deleting
    
    *** Comparison complete
    
    *** /var/tmp/temproot is empty, deleting
    

I already am on FreeBSD 10, but this box is updated from 8 to 9 to 10, so maybe
that didn't work out quite well. Installing unbound via pkg did work:

    
    
    pkg install unbound
    

It seemed that it was half done:

    
    
    Proceed with installing packages [y/N]: y
    ldns-1.6.17.txz 
    unbound-1.4.22.txz
    Checking integrity... done
    [1/2] Installing ldns-1.6.17... done
    [2/2] Installing unbound-1.4.22...===> Creating users and/or groups.
    Using existing group 'unbound'.
    Creating user 'unbound' with uid '59'.
     done
    

Oh wel... Now the `make installworld` continues;

    
    
    make installworld
    

After that finished we can do another mergemaster:

    
    
    mergemaster -Ui 
    

Only `/etc/motd` changed, so, no big things.

Time to reboot:

    
    
    shutdown -r now
    

Remove old files and libraries:

    
    
    cd /usr/src
    make check-old
    >>> Checking for old files
    >>> Checking for old libraries
    >>> Checking for old directories
    To remove old files and directories run 'make delete-old'.
    To remove old libraries run 'make delete-old-libs'.
    
    make delete-old
    >>> Removing old files (only deletes safe to delete libs)
    remove /usr/include/clang/3.3/__wmmintrin_aes.h? y
    remove /usr/include/clang/3.3/__wmmintrin_pclmul.h? y
    remove /usr/include/clang/3.3/altivec.h? y
    remove /usr/include/clang/3.3/ammintrin.h? y
    [...]
    >>> Old files removed
    >>> Removing old directories
    >>> Old directories removed
    To remove old libraries run 'make delete-old-libs'.
    
    
    
    make delete-old-libs
    >>> Removing old libraries
    Please be sure no application still uses those libraries, else you
    can not start such an application. Consult UPDATING for more
    information regarding how to cope with the removal/revision bump
    of a specific library.
    >>> Old libraries removed
    

Note that freebsd-update does not work with the STABLE branch. Therefore this
process is required.

That's it. Run `freebsd-version` to see that you are now on stable:

    
    
    freebsd-version
    10.0-STABLE
