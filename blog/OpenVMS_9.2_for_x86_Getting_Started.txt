OpenVMS on x86 is now available for hobbyists! Almost a year after [the official release](/s/blog/OpenVMS_9.2_for_x86_will_be_released_tomorrow.html). This is a part 1 of my getting started guide, showing you how to install OpenVMS on VirtualBox on Windows 10/11. More parts will follow, documenting license installation, network setup, ssh, application installation etc.

This guide is a summarized / shorter version of [the official installation
guide][7]. It is taylored for hobbyist usage using VirtualBox and helps you to
get set up quickly. Please refer to the official documentation for any questions.
The official documentation is targeted at VMWare ESXi, this guide is for VirtualBox.

- Update: 16-4-2023: [You can read part 3 of the guide here][17].
- Update: 14-8-2024: [Serial port is no longer needed and CDE/Decwindows now work, see this page](/s/blog/OpenVMS_x86_E9.2-3_fixes_CDE_and_adds_Guest_Console.html).

### Disable Hyper-V and install VirtualBox

You'll need to install [VirtualBox][5] and disable Hyper-V, otherwise you will
get a [boot error][6], `No XSAVE instruction`. Installing VirtualBox is a 
matter of downloading the installer and clicking next/next/next a few times.

Disabling Hyper-V is a bit more work. On an adminstrative command prompt,
execute the following and reboot:

     bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
 
To turn Hyper-V back on, change `off` to `auto`. 



In newer versions of Windows 11 you also need to turn off Memory Integrity. 

Navigate to `Start` > `Settings` > `Update & Security` > `Windows Security` > 
`Device security` > `Core isolation` > `Memory integrity`. 

Alternatively, you can disable VBS completely in the `Group Policy Editor` 
under `Computer Configuration` > `Administrative Templates` > `System` > 
`Device Guard` > `Turn On Virtualization Based Security`.

I suspected that WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) would stop working, but
my WSL 1 installation continued to work. All of my WSL 2 installations are
broken, which is expected since they use Hyper-V. They now give the following
error code:

    WSL2 wordt niet ondersteund met uw huidige computerconfiguratie.
    Schakel het optionele onderdeel Virtual Machine Platform in en zorg ervoor dat virtualisatie is ingeschakeld in het BIOS.
    Ga naar https://aka.ms/enablevirtualization voor meer informatie
    

Switching Hyper-V on again (`bcedit` command) and rebooting makes them work
again without data loss, so it's like the good old days of dual-booting in some
sense.    

You'll also need a `Telnet` client. [Putty][11] is a great one for Windows,
but I'm using my (WSL1) linux terminal for it.


I have received reports that VMWare Player works without disabling Hyper-V
and that some folks only had to disable Memory Integrety on Windows 11, not
also disable Hyper-V. Not tested those myself though.

### How to get OpenVMS 9.2 for Hobbyists

You must be [a registered hobbyist][4] user. After registration you
can download `X86E921OE.ZIP` and the PAK (license)
files (`x86community-20240401.zip`) from [https://sp.vmssoftware.com][8]:


![sp.vmssoftware.com][9]


Extract the ISO file. Ignore the `.VNC` file, I'm not sure what it is for, 
I did not need it.

### Booting the OpenVMS 9.2 x86 installation in VirtualBox


Fire up Virtualbox and create a new Virtual Machine. Select OS / Type `Other / Unknown 64 Bit`
and give the VM at least 6 GB of RAM and 2 cores, as per [the official guide][8].
Attatch 2 disks, I did 2 of 20 GB and I also enabled UEFI. From [the PDF manual][15]:

1. In the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager window, click Machine, then New.
1. In the Name field, enter a VM name
1. Accept the default for the Machine Folder field, set Type to `Other`, and Version to `Other/Unknown (64-bit).`
1. Click Next. VSI recommends that you set the memory size to `6144MB`, then click Next again.
1. Select "Do not add a virtual hard disk", then click Create and Continue from the warning.
1. Select Settings for the new VM and click System.
1. In the Motherboard tab, uncheck Floppy and Optical, choose Chipset `ICH9`, and check Enable EFI.
1. In the Processor tab, VSI recommends that you set the CPU count to at least 2.
1. Select Storage from the settings menu.
1. Click Add controller, select the `AHCI (SATA)` type controller. 
1. Add four disks to this controller in the following order:
-  `VM1_sysdisk_name.VMDK` (as a hard disk)
-  `VM1_paging_disk_name.VMDK` (as a hard disk)
-  `X86092OE.ISO` (as an optical drive)
-  `VM2_sysdisk_name.VMDK` (as a hard disk)
1. You must add each disk to the available drives first, and then select it for the VM.


On the `Serial Port` screen, enable COM1, select `Port Mode`: `TCP`
and enter `1023` in the `Path/Address` field. Make sure that `Connect to 
existing pipe/socket` is unchecked:

![serial settings][10]

This serial port is required for the installation. 

Couple the installation ISO in the VM settings and start the machine. In 
the UEFI boot screen, look at the `Mapping Table` and see which device
says `CDROM`. In my case it was `fs0`. Enter the following command at the EFI
prompt:

    fs0:\EFI\VMS\VMS_BOOTMGR.EFI

Replace `fs0` with your cdrom disk. You should now see the following boot 
screen:

![bootscreen][12]


Notice the yellow text stating: `CONNECT A REMOTE TERMINAL SESSION NOW.`


- Update 14-08-2024: [Serial port is no longer needed and CDE/Decwindows now work, see this page](/s/blog/OpenVMS_x86_E9.2-3_fixes_CDE_and_adds_Guest_Console.html).

In your telnet client, connect to `127.0.0.1` port `1023`, see my screenshot.

Enter the command `DEVICES` (all capitals) to see the boot device, in my
case `DKA200`.

Enter the command `BOOT DKA200` to start. The terminal will show the loading
progress as will your VirtualBox:

![boot loading][13]

When the loading is finished, the VirtualBox screen will show:

![GRAPHIC OUTPUT SUSPENDED][14]


Continue on in your Telnet terminal.
        


### OpenVMS 9.2 x86 installation

The telnet terminal will continue printing output, the VirtualBox screen does
not show anything anymore. One of the things you'll notice is the following
message:

      VirtualBox users must enable the HPET clock source one-time using the
      following command: 
      vboxmanage modifyvm {your-vm-name} --hpet on

In my case, the VM is named `openvms-9.2-raymii`. After the installation has
finished and the VM is off, you must execute the command provided in an 
administrative command prompt:

    "\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe" modifyvm openvms-9.2-raymii --hpet on

The TELNET prompt will now show:



        VMS Software, Inc. OpenVMS (TM) x86_64 Operating System, E9.2-1
                    Copyright 2023 VMS Software, Inc.

    [...]

    You can install or upgrade the OpenVMS X86-64 operating system
    or you can install or upgrade layered products that are included
    on the OpenVMS X86-64 distribution media.

    You can also execute DCL commands and procedures to perform
    "standalone" tasks, such as backing up the system disk.

    Please choose one of the following:

        1)  Upgrade, install or reconfigure OpenVMS X86-64 Version E9.2-1
        2)  Display layered products that this procedure can install
        3)  Install or upgrade layered products

        8)  Execute DCL commands and procedures
        9)  Shut down this system


Press and hold `CTRL`, then press `]`. The prompt changes to `telnet>`. You
need to enter the command:

    unset crlf

Press `CTRL+]` again and enter another command:

    mode char

If you don't do this, you cannot enter a `SYSTEM` account password later on.

Continue with the installation. Enter `1` as your choice. The prompt reads:

    This procedure installs the OpenVMS X86-64 operating system.

    All software and data files that were previously on the
        target disk will be removed.

    Do you want to INITIALIZE or to PRESERVE? [PRESERVE] 

Enter `INITIALIZE` as your choice. The prompt reads:



    You must enter the device name for the target disk on which
    OpenVMS X86-64 will be installed.

    Enter device name for target disk: (? for choices) ?
    ?

      Device Name       Device Type Name        Volume Label     Size (blocks/xB)
      ------------  -------------------------  --------------  --------------------
      DKA0:         ATA VBOX HARDDISK
      DKA100:       ATA VBOX HARDDISK

      For volume label and device size enter ??


    Enter device name for target disk: (? for choices)


If you receive an error like "No devices found", make sure you've selected 
`IC9` as the chipset and `AHCI/SATA` as the controller type.

Enter `DKA0`. The prompt reads:

    Enter volume label for target system disk: [X86SYS] 

Press `ENTER` to accept the default. The prompt reads:



    OpenVMS V9.0 and later requires that the target system disk be
    initialized with On-Disk Structure Level 5 (ODS-5).


    Hard links can be enabled on ODS-5 disks.  WBEM Services for OpenVMS
    does not require hard links.  (? for more information)

    Do you want to enable hard links? (Yes/No/?)

Enter `Y`. The prompt reads:


    You have chosen to install OpenVMS X86-64 on a new disk.

    The target system disk, DKA0:, will be initialized
    with structure level 5 (ODS-5).
    Hard links WILL be enabled.
    The disk will be labeled X86SYS.
    Any data currently on the target system disk will be lost.

    Is this OK? (Yes/No)


Enter `Y`. The prompt reads:

Y

    Initializing and mounting target....

    Creating page file....


    You must enter a password for the SYSTEM account.

    The password must be a minimum of 8 characters in length, and
    may not exceed 31 characters.  It will be checked and verified.
    The system will not accept passwords that can be guessed easily.

    The password will not be displayed as you enter it.

Enter a password for the `SYSTEM` user. In my example I used `PASSW0RD`.

The prompt reads:

    Password for SYSTEM account:

    Re-enter SYSTEM password for verification:

        For your system to operate properly, you must set two parameters:
        SCSNODE and SCSSYSTEMID.

        SCSNODE can be from 1 to 6 letters or numbers.  It must contain at
        least one letter.

        If you plan to use DECnet, SCSNODE must be the DECnet Phase IV
        node name, or the DECnet-Plus (Phase V) node synonym.

        If you have multiple OpenVMS systems, the SCSNODE on each system
        must be unique.

    Enter SCSNODE:


I entered the intented hostname here, `REMY1`. The prompt reads:


    If you plan to use DECnet, SCSSYSTEMID must be set based on the
    DECnet Phase IV address.

    Do you plan to use DECnet? (Yes/No) [Yes] 

Enter `Y`. The prompt reads:


    DECnet Phase IV addresses are in the format

        DECnet_area_number.DECnet_node_number

    DECnet_area_number is a number between 1 and 63.
    DECnet_node_number is a number between 1 and 1023.

    If you plan to use DECnet WITHOUT Phase IV compatible addresses,
    enter 0.0.


    Enter DECnet (Phase IV) Address: [1.1]


I entered `1.42`. The prompt reads:


      SCSSYSTEMID will be set to 1066.

      This was calculated as follows:

          (DECnet_area_number * 1024) + DECnet_node_number

    Select the number above that best represents the desired time zone:


I entered `20`, then `1`, for `AMSTERDAM` but you should choose the time zone closest to you.
The prompt reads:


    You selected EUROPE / AMSTERDAM as your time zone.
    Is this correct? (Yes/No) [YES]: 


Confirm with `Y`. The prompt reads: 

    Configuring the Time Differential Factor (TDF)

    Default Time Differential Factor for standard time is 1:00.
    Default Time Differential Factor for daylight saving time is 2:00.

    The Time Differential Factor (TDF) is the difference between your
    system time and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  UTC is similar
    in most respects to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

    The TDF is expressed as hours and minutes, and should be entered
    in the hh:mm format.  TDFs for the Americas will be negative
    (-3:00, -4:00, etc.); TDFs for Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia
    will be positive (1:00, 2:00, etc.).

    This time zone supports daylight saving time.
    Is this time zone currently on daylight saving time? (Yes/No): 

I entered `N`. The prompt reads:

    Enter the Time Differential Factor [1:00]:

I pressed `ENTER` for the default. The prompt reads:

    NEW SYSTEM TIME DIFFERENTIAL FACTOR = 1:00

    Is this correct? [Y]: 

Confirm with `Y`. The prompt reads:



    If you have Product Authorization Keys (PAKs) to register,
    you can register them now.

    Do you want to register any Product Authorization Keys? (Yes/No) [Yes]    


Enter `NO` to decline. We will register `PAKs` later on after installation.
During installation it's a pain to manually copy and paste them. Later on we 
can just mount an ISO file.

The prompt reads:



    The following products are part of the OpenVMS installation;
    they will be installed along with the OpenVMS operating system:

        o Availability Manager (base) for OpenVMS X86-64
        o TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS X86-64
        o KERBEROS for OpenVMS X86-64

        o OpenSSH for OpenVMS X86-64
        o 64-bit PERL for OpenVMS X86-64

    You can also install the following optional products along with the
    OpenVMS operating system:

        o DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS X86-64
        o DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS X86-64
        o DECnet Phase IV for OpenVMS X86-64

    If you want to change your selections, you can do so later in the
    installation by answering "NO" to the following question:

        "Do you want the defaults for all options?"

    Do you want to install DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS X86-64 V1.8?    

Confirm with `Y`. The prompt reads:

    The DECnet-Plus kit is provided with the OpenVMS operating system kit.
    DECnet Phase IV applications are supported by DECnet-Plus.

    DECnet Phase IV is also provided as an option.

    If you install DECnet-Plus and TCP/IP you can run DECnet
    applications over a TCP/IP network.  Please refer to the
    VSI DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS Planning Guide for information
    on running DECnet over TCP/IP.

    Do you want to install DECnet-Plus for OpenVMS X86-64 V9.2-D? (Yes/No) [Yes]

Confirm with `Y`. The prompt reads:    

    The installation operation can provide brief or detailed descriptions.
    In either case, you can request the detailed descriptions by typing ?.

    Do you always want detailed descriptions? (Yes/No) [No]


Confirm with `NO`. The installer will now validate files:

              command procedure, assuming you installed in SYS$COMMON.

                $ @sys$common:[perl-5_34]perl_setup.com

              You may wish to put that command in SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM to
              make Perl available to all users on the system.

              Perl includes its own help system called perldoc.  Type

                $ perldoc perldoc

              for the documentation to perldoc itself.  Type

                $ perldoc perldelta

              for the changes that are new in version T5.34-0 of Perl.

You're now done with the installation. Press `ENTER` to reboot.


### First boot of your OpenVMS 9.2 x86

Return to the VirtualBox window, do not close your telnet terminal. You should
be at the UEFI prompt again. This time, boot from the disk where we installed
OpenVMS. This should be the disk that does not show `CDROM` in the `Mapping
Table`. In my case, the CDROM was now `fs1` and the disk was `fs0`. The command
is the same:

    fs0:\EFI\VMS\VMS_BOOTMGR.EFI

Return to your telnet terminal. Enter the `DEVICES` command again, you should 
now see your freshly installed disk:

    BOOTMGR> DEVICES

    BOOTABLE DEVICES (System Disks, Installation Kits, other):

      DKA200     (DVD) = FS1    UEFI: E9_2_1       VMS: None         1574  MB  SATA DVD

Enter the command `BOOT DKA0` to boot from the installed system (the disk we
named `X86SYS`). A whole bunch of output appears:

Before continueing with the network and SSH setup, remember that clock / hpet
command? Shutdown the system with the `SHUTDOWN` command. Then, on an administrative
Windows Command Prompt, enter the command:

    "\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe" modifyvm openvms-9.2-raymii --hpet on


### Configuring PAKs and networking

The next part of this guide will show you how to install the PAKs (license keys)
and how to setup networking / SSH. You can look [at my other OpenVMS articles][2]
to read more on OpenVMS usage. 

Update: 15-4-2023: [You can read the next part of the guide here][16].
