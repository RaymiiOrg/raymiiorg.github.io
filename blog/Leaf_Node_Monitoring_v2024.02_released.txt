I'm pleased to announce the next version of Leaf Node Monitoring, the simple and easy to use open source site and server monitoring tool. Major new features include minimizing to the tray, automatic startup on Windows and Linux and a new check, SSL Certificate Expiry. This post goes over everything that is new in this release.

This post is cross-posted on [the official Leaf Node Monitoring]
(https://www.leafnode.nl/news/leaf-node-monitoring-2024-02-released-with-minimize-to-tray-and-ssl-certificate-expiry-checks/)
website.

[You can download the new version here.](https://www.leafnode.nl/download)


**Leaf Node Monitoring v2024.02** is now available for download and as a free
  upgrade for previous customers. This release features minimizing to the
  tray, automatic startup on Windows and Linux and a new check, SSL
  Certificate Expiry.


### Autostart & minimize to tray

This release can minimize to tray and automatically start up (even minimized).
This is less intrusive and allows you, the user, to have Leaf Node Monitoring
launch at startup and send a notification when stuff is wrong, without any
visual disturbance.

When Leaf Node Monitoring automatically starts up you will receive one notification informing you that it has started.

### SSL Certificate expiry check

The other new feature is a new check type for expiry of SSL certificates. This
will alert you when your certificate is about to expire or is expired.
Opening the check will give you information on which specific certificate in
the chain is expiring:

You can configure when the check should give a warning and when it should give an error:

### Leaf Node Monitoring v2024.02 is now available

The Google Play store version is updated and the downloads here on the website
are as well. If you purchase via the website you can choose your own price.
You get an archive with a Windows Installer, a Linux AppImage, the source
code and an Android APK. If you purchase via the Google Play Store the price
is set and you only get an APK. That [APK is able to export it's own source code](https://www.leafnode.nl/source-code/)
, so you are able to compile for other platforms if you wish.
