Here are some small titbits I found out this week on the DECUServe OpenVMS
system. Not enough to write a blogpost on their own, but collected together.

### .bash_history

To show your shell history from the current session:

    
    
    $ RECALL/ALL
    

Output:

    
    
      1 show proc
      2 proc
      3 htop
      4 top
      5 notes
      6 t
      7 hobbyist
      8 hobbyi
      9 show license
     10 show terminal
     11 set terminal /backspace=delete
     12 show terminal
     13 set terminal /backspace=backspace
     14 show terminal
     15 hello this is a test
    $
    

### Uptime and /etc/redhat_release

To view system uptime and OpenVMS version:

    
    
    $ SHOW SYSTEM /NOPROC
    

Output:

    
    
    OpenVMS V8.4-2L2  on node EISNER    8-APR-2018 14:13:11.07   Uptime  17 03:22:55
    

### w

Show all the logged in users and their process, like the `w` command on linux:

    
    
    $ SHOW USERS /FULL
          OpenVMS User Processes at  8-APR-2018 14:19:05.07
        Total number of users = 6,  number of processes = 6
    
     Username     Process Name      PID     Terminal
     <login>      _VTA4425:       00009B23  VTA4425: (disconnected)
     EXAMPLE         SSHD 0355A PTD  00008EE4  FTA550:  (ssh/$IP:57039)
     GOATLEY      Goat Busters    00009A55  FTA547:
                                        (ssh/$HOSTNAME.com:17251)

     MALMBERG     >>>B ewa0:      00009664  FTA543:
                                         (ssh/$IP:59826)
     SCHENKENBERG SCHENKENBERG    00007E83  FTA442:
                                          (ssh/ool-$HOSTNAME:47078)
    

### cd ~

Your home directory on OpenVMS is not known as `~` (as on UNIX) but as
`SYS$LOGIN`. As we learned in an earlier article, OpenVMS uses the `SET/SHOW
DEFAULT` commands to navigate directories. So the equivalent of `cd ~` on linux,
or even shorter, `cd` is `SET DEF SYS$LOGIN`:

    
    
    $ SET DEFAULT SYS$LOGIN
    $ SHOW DEF
      DISK_USER:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE]
    
    $ DIR SYS$LOGIN
    
    Directory EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE]
    
    $MAIN.TPU$JOURNAL;1 .VIMINFO;1          A.;1                ICREATEDAFOLDERYAY.DIR;1
    LOGIN.COM;2         LOGIN.COM;1         LOGIN_COM.TPU$JOURNAL;1
    MAIL$AC8D2981000500B2.MAI;1             MAIL.MAI;1          NOTES$NOTEBOOK.NOTE;1
    RAYMII.DIR;1        REMY.DAT;3          REMY.DAT;2          REMY.DAT;1
    SSH.DIR;1           SSH2.DIR;1          SSH3.DIR;1          WWW.DIR;1
    Total of 18 files.
    

### cd ..

The equivalent of the `cd ..`, to go up one folder on linux, on OpenVMS is
`[-]`. So if you are in `EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE.WWW]` and want to
go up one level to `EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE]` then enter:

    
    
     $ SET DEFAULT [-]
    

### %SYSTEM-F-ACCVIO, access violation,

I also hit my first bug. I was writing a note (in `NOTES`, a kind of forum) and
I pasted a link. It crashed with the following error:

    
    
    Fatal DECTPU internal error, please submit an SPR including:
    
         1.  A description of the actions that revealed the bug
         2.  The versions of DECTPU and the operating system you are running
         3.  Machine-readable media containing:
             - The source files of your DECTPU section and command files
             - Copies of the data files used during the session
             - The keystroke journal file if one exists
         4.  Your terminal characteristics, if applicable
         5.  A description of the command used to invoke DECTPU
    
    Shareable base: 7BC54884  Ident: DECTPU V3.2  2017-05-22 22:49
    Updater base:   7C03E034  Ident: DECTPU V3.2  2017-05-22 22:49
    Updater file:   TPU$CCTSHR
    
    %SYSTEM-F-ACCVIO, access violation, reason mask=00, virtual address=0000000000000024, PC=00000000000B5A14, PS=0000001B
    $
    

So I retyped the note and pasted the error in, maybe someone knows more.

Edit: they know more on the DECUS system. This happens when you CRTL+C out of
the NOTES application.

### MAIL, folders and mail management

See [this article][4] as well.

#### List email

    
    
    MAIL> dir
                                                                                MAIL
          # From                 Date         Subject
    
          1 EISNER::CORNELIUS    29-MAR-2018  Hello again
        2 (Deleted)
          3 EISNER::CORNELIUS    31-MAR-2018  RE: Hello again
          4 EISNER::PARRIS        2-APR-2018  RE: Test message
    
    MAIL>
    

#### List folders

    
    
        MAIL> DIR /FOLDER
        Listing of folders in EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE]MAIL.MAI
             Press CTRL/C to cancel listing
        MAIL                                    TEST
    
        MAIL>
    

#### List mail in folder

    
    
    MAIL> dir TEST
                                                                                TEST
          # From                 Date         Subject
    
          1 IN%"example@example.nl"  31-MAR-2018  RE: Tesrt message
    
    MAIL>
    

Regular `DIR` will list the `MAIL` folder.

#### Move message into a folder

To store a message in a folder, use the `FILE` command in the `MAIL` program:

    
    
    MAIL> file test
    Folder TEST does not exist.
    Do you want to create it (Y/N, default is N)? y
    %MAIL-I-NEWFOLDER, folder TEST created
    
    MAIL>
    

As you can see, if the folder does not exist, it will be created.

#### Delete a message

OpenVMS `MAIL` doesn't delete messages immediately but moves them from your
default folder to a folder called `WASTEBASKET`.

On most OpenVMS systems the `WASTEBASKET` is purged when the you use the
command, `EXIT` to exit `MAIL`. If you use the command, `QUIT`, the old, deleted
mail remains in the `WASTEBASKET`. If you're in a hurry to purge the
`WASTEBASKET`, then you can do it manually with the `PURGE` command.

    
    
    MAIL> dir TEST
                                                                                TEST
          # From                 Date         Subject
    
          1 IN%"example@example.nl"  31-MAR-2018  RE: Tesrt message
    
    MAIL> del 1
    
    MAIL> dir WASTEBASKET
                                                                         WASTEBASKET
          # From                 Date         Subject
    
          1 IN%"example@example.nl"  31-MAR-2018  RE: Tesrt message
    
    MAIL> purge
    %MAIL-I-DELMSGS, 1 message deleted
    

#### Mail filesystem folder

By default all mail related files are stored in your home directory. This can
become quite a full listing, you can change it to another folder. In the `MAIL`
program, enter the following command:

    
    
    MAIL> SET MAIL [.MAIL]
    %MAIL-I-CREATED, DISK_USER:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE.MAIL] created
    

Now mail related files will be placed in `[.MAIL]` and your home directory will
stay a bit cleaner.

### ls -la (list files, owner and permissions)

With the `DIR` command, two flags can be given, `/PROTECTION` and `/OWNER`, to
get a more comprehensive list including the file owner and permissions:

    
    
     $ DIR /OWNER /PROTECTION
    
    Directory DSA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE]
    
    $MAIN.TPU$JOURNAL;1
                         [EXAMPLE]                           (RWED,RWED,,)
    .VIMINFO;1           [EXAMPLE]                           (RWED,RWED,,)
