As of the 18th of February, OpenVMS, known for its stability and high-availability, 47 years old and ported to 4 different CPU architecture, has a package manager!
This article shows you how to use the package manager and talks about a few of its quirks. It's an early beta version, and you do notice that when using it.
A small list of things I noticed, coming from a Linux (apt/yum/dnf) background:
There seems to be no automatic dependency resolution and the dependencies it does list are incomplete. No update management yet and no support for your own package repository, only the VSI official one. Service startup or login script changes are not done automatically. Packages with multiple installer files fail and require manual intervention.
It does correctly identify the architectures, has search support and makes it way easier to install software.
The time saved by downloading, manually copying and starting installation is huge, so even this early beta is a very welcome addition to OpenVMS.


VSI describes it in their early version manual like this:

> VSP is a package management tool for OpenVMS which uses VMS Service Platform
  REST API to manage and install PCSI packages.


![VSP list](/s/inc/img/5b58347c733240c9b4b5fe295b25a396.png)

> OpenVMS VSP Package manager

For example, installing the latest C++ compiler is now as easy as executing
this command:

    VSP> DOWNLOAD /INSTALL VSI-X86VMS-CXX-A1001-3_250204-1

(Or it would be if the package manager supported packages with multiple
installers inside it, in this case the main installer and a patch. But
more on that later on.)

I've done all my testing on OpenVMS x86 since I have no Itanium hardware to
test on. To follow along with this article, you do need to  OpenVMS E9.2-3.
You can either apply to the [Ambassador Program](https://vmssoftware.com/products/licenses/),

### Summary

If you don't want to read any technical details, here's a summary.

VSP simplifies package management on OpenVMS, allowing you to search,
download, and install software with simple commands, replacing manual
downloading, extracting and installing software.

Current Features:

- Package search for available software.
- One-command installations.
- Centralized repository access.

Current Limitations:

- No automatic dependency resolution.
- Packages with multiple installers fail (e.g., main+patch)
- Lacks update management.
- No support for private repositories.

Future improvements, to match modern package managers (APT, YUM, DNF), VSP
needs:

- Automated dependency handling.
- Update and upgrade capabilities.
- Private repository support.

Though in early beta, VSP is an amazing step forward for efficient OpenVMS
software management.


Lets continue on diving into the fun part.

### Installing the OpenVMS Package Manager (VSP)

You need to download this file from the VSI Service Portal:

    VSI-X86VMS-VSP-E0100-0-1
    File Size:17.24 MB (18 080 118 bytes)
    MD5 Checksum:28b1dfc0ee1426981a5f44fc1dd61633

Copy it over to your OpenVMS installation. I've got a specific folder for my random stuff:

  
    $ show def
      REMY1$DKA100:[REMY]
    
    $ dir
    Directory REMY1$DKA100:[REMY]
    
    VSI-X86VMS-VSP-E0100-0-1^(1^).zip;1     VSI-X86VMS-VSP-E0100-0-1.PCSI$COMPRESSED;1
    VSI-X86VMS-VSP-E0100-0-1.PCSI$COMPRESSED_VNC;1

Don't forget to install `SSL 111`, SSL3 does not work.


Start the Product Installation:

     PRODUCT INSTALL VSP

The installation failed when I tried it the first with a validation error:


    Performing product kit validation of signed kits ...
    
    %PCSI-E-VALFAILED, validation of REMY1$DKA100:[REMY]VSI-X86VMS-VSP-E0100-0-1.PCSI$COMPRESSED;1 failed
    -PCSI-E-VSI_TEXT, Verification of signed file failed

    error no <478674948>, text: <error:1C880004:Provider routines::RSA lib>
    Failed
    
    %PCSIUI-E-ABORT, operation terminated due to an unrecoverable error condition
    

After removing all files in the folder and `unzip`-ing them once more, the
install continued on:

    
    $ PRODUCT INSTALL VSP
    
    Performing product kit validation of signed kits ...
    %PCSI-I-VSIVALPASSED, validation of REMY1$DKA100:[REMY]VSI-X86VMS-VSP-E0100-0-1.PCSI$COMPRESSED;2 succeeded
    
    The following product has been selected:
        VSI X86VMS VSP E1.0-0                  Layered Product
    
    Do you want to continue? [YES] y
    
    Configuration phase starting ...
    
    You will be asked to choose options, if any, for each selected product and for
    any products that may be installed to satisfy software dependency requirements.
    
    Configuring VSI X86VMS VSP E1.0-0

    * This product does not have any configuration options.
    
    Execution phase starting ...
    
    The following product will be installed to destination:
        VSI X86VMS VSP E1.0-0

    VSI X86VMS VSP E1.0-0
    
        Post-installation tasks are required.
    
    
        To allow all users to use the VSP utility, add the following foreign
        command definition to SYS$MANAGER:SYLOGIN.COM:
    
            $ VSP :== $SYS$COMMON:[VSP]VSP.EXE


Don't forget to add `VSP` to your `SYLOGIN.COM` file. For now, we can continue
on by manually defining the foreign command:

     VSP :== $SYS$COMMON:[VSP]VSP.EXE


### Using the package manager (VSP)

The package manager only works with the `VSI` service portal, no possibility
for your own repositories (yet?). Therefore you must login with your Service
Portal Credentials. Start `VSP`, then enter the `LOGIN` command:

    
    $ VSP

Output:

    Most functionality is unavailable without a valid login.
    OS version of current system is: E9.2-3.
    vsp> 

On the new `vsp>` prompt, login with your VSI credentials:

    vsp> LOGIN

Output:

    _USERNAME: VSI_SP_username
    _PASSWORD: NOT_SHOWN
    Save user credentials (encrypted)? (Y/N): y


The login cookie is saved to a text file if you choose YES. It shows that the
`VSP` tool uses `libcurl`:

    $ type cookies.txt
    # Netscape HTTP Cookie File
    # https://curl.se/docs/http-cookies.html
    # This file was generated by libcurl! Edit at your own risk.
    
    #HttpOnly_sp.vmssoftware.com    FALSE   /       FALSE   0       session a[bcd].e
    sp.vmssoftware.com              FALSE   /       TRUE    191....789      csrf_access_token       a[...]a
    #HttpOnly_sp.vmssoftware.com    FALSE   /       TRUE    191....789      access_token_cookie     b[...]b
    


After logging in, check to make sure the correct account is used:

    vsp> whoami
    Username:      Your Name
    Email:         Your Email
    Organization:  VMS Ambassadors Programme

The cookie is only valid for a certain amount of time, the manual stated 30 minutes.

### Listing all available packages

Use the `LIST PRODUCTS` command to get a list of all available packages: 
    

    vsp>    list

Basically all packages you can see in the software portal are 
here as well.

### List all installed packages

I'm not sure why they include the architecture in this output. 
How would you install Itanium packages on X86?

### Downloading packages

The packages must first be downloaded before they can be installed. Later on
in this guide I'll show you a command to do both at once.

Let's try [the WebUI](/s/blog/OpenVMS_9.2_for_x86_Getting_Started_part_3.html) 
using the `DOWNLOAD` command:

    vsp> DOWNLOAD X86VMS-WEBUI-V0401-3-1

Output:

    ------------------------------------------
    The package has following dependencies:
    1: X86VMS-LUA-V0503-5H-1
    ------------------------------------------
    
    Downloading file "VSI-X86VMS-WEBUI-V0401-3-1.zip"
    Progress     3%   Time remaining   1:34
    Verifying checksum... OK


### Installing packages

When the download is complete, you can install the package using the `INSTALL`
command:
  
  
    vsp> INSTALL X86VMS-WEBUI-V0401-3-1

Output:

    ------------------------------------------
    The package has following dependencies:
    1: X86VMS-LUA-V0503-5H-1
    ------------------------------------------

    Minimum Lua software version not found on this system, abort instalation
    
    This kit requires a minimum Lua software version of V5.3-5F.
    
    Terminating is strongly recommended.  Do you want to terminate? [YES]
  

That's a bummer. The package manager detected that a Lua dependency was
required, but did not automatically download nor installed it.

### Dependency Management?

I didn't find any reference to dependency management in the README, so lets
try to download and install the dependency ourselves. 

You can use the `/INSTALL` flag in the download command to do both at the same
time.


    vsp> DOWNLOAD /INSTALL X86VMS-LUA-V0503-5H-1 

Output, even more dependencies:

    ------------------------------------------
    The package has following dependencies:

        To start the Lua runtime at system boot time, add the following
        lines to SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM:
    
            $ file := SYS$STARTUP:LUA$STARTUP.COM
            $ if f$search("''file'") .nes. "" then @'file'
    
        To stop Lua at system shutdown, add the following lines to
        SYS$MANAGER:SYSHUTDWN.COM:
    
            $ file := SYS$STARTUP:LUA$SHUTDOWN.COM
            $ if f$search("''file'") .nes. "" then @'file'
    


As always, the output of software installation is very verbose
and tells you everything you need to do to get stuff running.
Very helpful.

#### Unlisted dependencies?
  
The next attempt at installing the WebUI gave the following error:

    
    Minimum Civetweb software version not found on this system, abort instalation
    
    This kit requires a minimum Civetweb software version of V1.17-0.
    
    Terminating is strongly recommended.  Do you want to terminate? [YES]

This was not listed as a dependency in the package manager output.

There is search support in the package manager though, I can just
enter **civetweb** and it prompts me for a list of options:
  
  
    vsp> DOWNLOAD /install civetweb

Output:

    Choose the correct package from list below:
    X86VMS-CIVETWEB-V0114-0D-1               V1.14-0D         [ "X86" ]                V9.2

I want the version that the WebUI installer tells me, using a wildcard:    

    vsp> DOWNLOAD /INSTALL civetweb*117

        To start the web server at system boot time, add the following
        lines to SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM:
    
            $ file := SYS$STARTUP:CIVETWEB$STARTUP.COM
            $ if f$search("''file'") .nes. "" then @'file'

            $ if f$search("''file'") .nes. "" then @'file'
    
        Note that default installation uses the SYSTEM account to run the
        web server process. It is generally recommended that you run the
        web server as using a less privileged account. This may be done
        by supplying the account name as a parameter to
        civetweb$startup.com or by defining the logical name
        civetweb$user as the desired account name. It is also recommended
        that you change the ownership of the civetweb$root:[000000...]
        directory tree to this account.

    Execution phase starting ...
    
    The following product will be installed to destination:
        VSI X86VMS WEBUI V4.1-3                DISK$X86SYS:[VMS$COMMON.]

    VSI X86VMS WEBUI V4.1-3
    
        Post-installation tasks are required.
    
        After installation you need to update civetweb$root:[conf]civetweb.conf and
        civetweb$root:[conf]services.conf as described in the release notes. After
        making the necessary changes you can restart the web server using the following
        command:
    
        $ @SYS$STARTUP:WEBUI$RESTART.COM
    Cleaning up...


The suggestions provided by the installers, editing the login or startup
files, must still be done manually. 

If you're used to Debian for example, where services are started right away
after `apt-get install`-ing them, that does not happen here. Much safer,
since otherwise services might be exposed when they're not properly 
configured or secured yet.

### Installing the C++ compiler

I hoped that the C++ compiler could be installed with the following command:

    vsp> download /install VSI-X86VMS-CXX-A1001-3_250204-1

That sadly fails, because the archive contained multiple PCSI files
(multiple installation files):

    Downloading file "VSI-X86VMS-CXX-A1001-3_250204-1.ZIP"
    Progress    99%   Time remaining   0:00
    Verifying checksum... OK
    
    [...]
    

    %VSP-E-ERROR, Archive "VSI-X86VMS-CXX-A1001-3_250204-1.ZIP" contain multiple PCSI files. Inspect it manually


The files are downloaded in the current folder, so inspecting or installing
them manually is not hard. Im in a test folder for the compiler, after trying
the above command, I can see the  `VSI-X86VMS-CXX-V1001-2U1-1.ZIP` file:


    $ dir
    
    Directory REMY1$DKA100:[CTEST]
    
    COOKIES.TXT;8       OPENVMS_ECO_KIT_RNOTES.PDF;1            VSI-X86VMS-CXX-V1001-2U1-1.ZIP;1
    X86VMS-CXX-V1001-2U1-1-RNOTES.PDF;1
    
    Total of 4 files.

This package contains both an installer and a patch:

    
    $ unzip VSI-X86VMS-CXX-V1001-2U1-1.ZIP
    Archive:  REMY1$DKA100:[CTEST]VSI-X86VMS-CXX-V1001-2U1-1.ZIP;1
      inflating: VSI-X86VMS-CXX-V1001-2U1-1.PCSI$COMPRESSED
      inflating: VSI-X86VMS-VMS923X_CXXFIXUP-V0100--4.PCSI$COMPRESSED

`PRODUCT INSTALL` also shows both:

    $ product install
    _Product name (* to show list): *
    
       1 - VSI X86VMS CXX V10.1-2U1            Layered Product
       2 - VSI X86VMS VMS923X_CXXFIXUP V1.0    Patch (remedial update)
       ? - Help
       E - Exit

The package manager could ask the user the same thing as `product install`
does. Version checking is done there as well:

    
    %PCSI-W-VERLOW, you have selected a lower version of an installed product
    -PCSI-W-VERINS, the installation of product VSI X86VMS CXX V10.1-2U1
    -PCSI-W-VERREM, will remove current product VSI X86VMS CXX A10.1-2_240805
    Do you want to continue? [YES] n
    

If you install an "update", the `product install` process notices that as
well:

    
    The following product will be installed to destination:
        VSI X86VMS CXX A10.1-3_250204          DISK$X86SYS:[VMS$COMMON.]
    The following product will be removed from destination:
        VSI X86VMS CXX A10.1-2_240805          DISK$X86SYS:[VMS$COMMON.]
            
    Portion done: 0%...40%...90%...100%
    
    The following product has been installed:
        VSI X86VMS CXX A10.1-3_250204          Layered Product
    The following product has been removed:
        VSI X86VMS CXX A10.1-2_240805          Layered Product
    

In this case I upgraded the C++ compiler from version `A10.1-2_240805` to `A10.1-3_250204`.

I think that the Software Portal repository / REST API needs some sort of 
extra manifest file describing package dependencies and versions.

### Conclusion

The package manager is still in early beta, but credit where credit is due,
VSI stated that in their documentation. The VSP package manager streamlines
software installation significantly compared to the traditional manual
process on OpenVMS.

The lack of automatic dependency resolution, update management, and support
for private repositories makes it feel a bit primitive compared to modern
package managers. However, its ability to search for, download, and install
software with a single command is a huge time-saver.

Hopefully, future versions will improve dependency handling and automation,
bringing OpenVMS package management closer to what Linux users are accustomed
to.
