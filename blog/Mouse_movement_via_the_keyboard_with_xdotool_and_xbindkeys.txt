I had a request from a friend to figure out how she could use her mouse via the
keyboard. Normally you would use [Mouse Keys][1], but she uses a [kinesis
freestyle2][2] which has no numpad. By using [xbindkeys][3] together with
[xdotool][4] we can use our own key combination to move the mouse keys.

Make sure the packages are installed:

    
    
    apt-get install xdotool xbindkeys
    

Use your window manager to let `xbindkeys` start at startup.

Append the following to your `~/.xbindkeysrc` file:

    
    
    # ALT SHIFT 
    # 10 up
    "xdotool mousemove_relative --sync -- 0 -10"
    Mod1+Shift+w
    
    # ALT SHIFT S
    # 10 down
    "xdotool mousemove_relative --sync -- 0 10"
    Mod1+Shift+s
    
    # ALT SHIFT A
    # 10 left
    "xdotool mousemove_relative --sync -- -10 0"
    Mod1+Shift+a
    
    # ALT SHIFT D
    # 10 right
    "xdotool mousemove_relative --sync -- 10 0"
    Mod1+Shift+d
    
    # ALT SHIFT Q
    # left click
    "sleep 1 && xdotool click 1"
    Mod1+Shift+q
    
    # ALT SHIFT E
    # right click
    "sleep 1 && xdotool click 3"
    Mod1+Shift+e
    

This will let you use the `WASD` combined with ALT and SHIFT to move the mouse.
The `Q` and `E` keys can be used to left and right click, but that is with a
delay of one second. Otherwise some applications like firefox interpret the
SHIFT as an instruction to open a new window which is not what we want in this
use case.
