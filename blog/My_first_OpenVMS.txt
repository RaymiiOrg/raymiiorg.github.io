Last week I registered myself with the DECUServe OpenVMS system. I also
registered with HP as an OpenVMS hobbyist and got OpenVMS 7.3 for VAX. This
small blog item describes my first steps with the hosted DECUS OpenVMS system.
I'm excited since I now know how to create folders, navigate the filesystem and
edit files. Oh and I had a nice chat with another OpenVMS user via the PHONE
program.

As I like to mess around with legacy systems like the [PDP-8][4] and the PDP-11,
VAX/VMS and thus OpenVMS seems to be a great step forward. Started out as a
hardware project to be a a 32-bit virtual address extension for the PDP-11, the
VAX saw it's birth at DEC around 1977. Accompanied with several operating
systems, like DEC systems before, the VAX could run a lot of software including
PDP-11 software. Also released around 1977 was VMS, one of the operating systems
for the VAX-11/780. Renamed to VAX/VMS with the release of version 2 in 1980.
Ported to the Alpha architecture and renamed OpenVMS with version 6 in 1992. In
2001 with version 8.2 it was ported to the Intel Itanium architecture and now
also being ported to the x86 architecture, hopefully ready in [2019, a port by
VMS Software Inc. (VSI)][5]. A venerable operating system with lots of history
behind it and a great future ahead.

Lively among [hobbyists][6] (Dutch article), with recent [articles on clustering][7] and [installing OpenVMS][8], I wanted to enjoy this as well, so I decided to register as a hobbyist with [HP Enterprise's OpenVMS Hobbyist program][9]. It is required to be part of a 'chapter' of OpenVMS Hobbyists, and `DECUServe` seems to be the only club left that allows registration and is open to all.

At first I did not fill in a number and chapter, but was contacted by HPe to
register with DECUS before I could become a member. So I did, via
<http://decus.org>.

### Navigating the filesystem

Now for the most exiting part of my OpenVMS journey yet, navigating the
filesystem. It is not as you would expect on a Linux/UNIX system, as `ls`
dropped me into some sort of file editor:

    
    
     $ ls
    
    [End of File]
    
    
    
    
     Buffer: $MAIN                                                                                                                                                            | Write | Insert | Forward
    
    (Pressed CTRL+Z)
    LSE> exit
    
    $
    

Okay, that's not working. Lets try the (Windows) alternative:

    
    
     $ DIR
    
    Directory EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE]
    
    $MAIN.TPU$JOURNAL;1 ICREATEDAFOLDERYAY.DIR;1                LOGIN.COM;1
    MAIL.MAI;1          NOTES$NOTEBOOK.NOTE;1                   REMY.DAT;2
    REMY.DAT;1          WWW.DIR;1
    
    Total of 8
    

To be honest, I found out that command after reading through 9 [chapters of
OpenVMS documentation][10] from HP.

As you can see I managed to create some files and a folder. As you might also
notice, the names and structure is way different that a Linux filesystem.

This is my understanding so far. OpenVMS directories are not seperated by a `/`
(as on UNIX) but a dot (`.`). A full file path can be addressed by it's file
specification that has the following format:

    
    
    node::device:[root.][directory]file-name.file-type;version  
    

So in the case above, there is an `INDEX.HTML` file in the `WWW` folder, which
can be addressed via:

    
    
    $ dir [.WWW]
    
    Directory EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE.WWW]
    
    INDEX.HTML;1
    
    Total of 1 file.
    

As far as I know a folder should be surrounded by `[brackets]` and the dot in
front of WWW specifies the current folder. I could also write the full file
specification:

    
    
     $ dir EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE.WWW]
    
    Directory EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE.WWW]
    
    INDEX.HTML;1
    
    Total of 1 file.
    

Creating a folder is not done with `mkdir`:

    
    
     $ mkdir raymii
    %DCL-W-IVVERB, unrecognized command verb - check validity and spelling
     \MKDIR\
    

But with the logically named `create` command, and the correct folder
specifications, with brackets and a leading dot:

    
    
     $ create /dir [.RAYMII]
     $ dir [.RAYMII]
    %DIRECT-W-NOFILES, no files found
    

Changing folders, again, not done with `cd`. Printing the current folder is not
`pwd` as well, but `show default`:

    
    
     $ show default
      DISK_USER:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE]
    

Changing the folder is `set default`:

    
    
     $ set default [.WWW]
     $ dir
    
    Directory EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE.WWW]
    
    INDEX.HTML;1
    
    Total of 1 file.
    

Changing back to the previous folder:

    
    
     $ set default DISK_USER:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE]
     $ dir
    Directory EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE]
    
    $MAIN.TPU$JOURNAL;1 ICREATEDAFOLDERYAY.DIR;1                LOGIN.COM;1
    MAIL.MAI;1          NOTES$NOTEBOOK.NOTE;1                   REMY.DAT;2
    REMY.DAT;1          WWW.DIR;1
    
    Total of 8 files.
     $
    

### Editing text files

I very briefly dabbled with `EVE` to create some files:

    
    
    EVE REMY.DAT
    
    hello
    print
    
    this is a test
    
    [End of file]
    
    
    
    
    
     Buffer: REMY.DAT                                                                                                                                                         | Write | Insert | Forward
    
    5 lines read from file EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE]REMY.DAT;2
    

It seems to be an interactive editor, pressing CTRL+Z saves the file:

    
    
    7 lines written to file EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE]REMY.DAT;3
    

Other editors are available, like `TECO`, which was on several PDP-8 operating
systems as well. To be continued in a new article.

### File versioning

As you saw in the above examples, OpenVMS by default supports file versioning.
On every file on it's filesystem. How awesome is that? 32,767 versions are
supported by default and there is nothing you have to do or remember. Just
create and edit files!

Managing versions is quite easy as well. Since the version number is appended to
the filename (`REMY.DAT;1`) after a semicolon, you just use file system commands
(which I haven't figured out yet) to remove or edit specific versions.

Editing version 2 of the file `REMY.DAT`:

    
    
    EVE REMY.DAT;2
    

Or using the `TYPE` command (`cat` on linux) to show the difference:

Version 2:

    
    
     $ type REMY.DAT;2
    hello
    print
    
    this is a test
    

Version 1:

    
    
     $ type REMY.DAT;1
    hello
    
    this is a test
    

I don't understand we don't have this as an option on modern linux systems to
enable. Windows has something like it, `VSS`, but that has to be set up and
provides only timed backups. This however is default and awesome.

### PHONE

Using the `SHOW USERS` command I was able to see a list of currently logged in
users:

    
    
     $ show users
          OpenVMS User Processes at 31-MAR-2018 14:46:06.54
        Total number of users = 9,  number of processes = 11
    
     Username         Interactive  Subprocess   Batch
     EXAMPLE                  1
     HARROD                1
     HENKLE                2         1
     JACKSON               1
     MALMBERG              1
     PARRIS                1
     REICHERT_D            1
     SCHENKENBERG          1
     SPALDING              1
    

There was a user online and I used the `PHONE` program to initiate a chat with
`CORNELIUS` (hi George). It was a nice chat, until work required attention. Exit
with CTRL+Z.

Thank you George for the nice talk we had!

The above image shows my discussion with George and my enthousiasm on just
having figured out how to create a folder on this OpenVMS system.

### Other commands

I found out, with the documentation, some other commands.

The `show` command shows general information:

    
    
     $ show system

The `HELP` command is very good as well:

    
    
     $ help show
    
    SHOW
    
         Displays information about the current status of a process, the
         system, or devices in the system.

### Conclusion

I'm very happy this system exists and that there are still other people around
to keep it running and let new folks like me enjoy and learn about it. The last
time I was so enthousiastic about navigating a file system was with the PDP-8
and OS/8, and now with OpenVMS. I do expect to learn more about OpenVMS and
eventually installing my own system with `simh` and the Hobbyist binaries I got
from HPe, including a ISO image for OpenVMS 7.3 for the VAX architecture.

I do have one unread email, but no idea how to read that. So that will be the
next challenge ahead, figure out how to read and reply to emails. Fun times
ahead!

Oh and I also don't know yet how to exit an SSH session other than closing the
window.
