Since [DECWindows / CDE](/s/blog/OpenVMS_x86_E9.2-3_fixes_CDE_and_adds_Guest_Console.html) now works on OpenVMS x86 (from 9.2-3 onwards) there is much fun stuff to do. Back in 2021 I wrote an article on the [CDE desktop on Alpha / AXPbox](/s/blog/OpenVMS_CDE_Desktop_remote_x_axpbox.html) and also an article on how to run [CDE on modern linux, since it's still developed](/s/blog/The_Common_Desktop_Environment_CDE_is_still_developed_in_2021.html#toc_6). Both articles included a game, **GENERIC-TETRIS** from 1992, [written by Qiang Alex Zhao](https://web.archive.org/web/20240815073318/https://sites.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/people/qiang.a.zhao/Games.html).
After getting the (remote) desktop working I wanted to compile and run Tetris to continue this lineage, from VAX, to Alpha, to Linux/CDE, to x86 VMS. I haven't got an Itanium to run it on, but if anyone has one left willing to send this way, feel free to contact me. This article includes the precompiled tetris binary for OpenVMS x86 and instructions to compile the source. The code required some minor modifications which I'll also cover, but that's not surprising for code that hasn't changed much since 1992 to be compiled in 2024. This article also shows you how to install curl on OpenVMS.

Here is Tetris running on OpenVMS 9.2-3 for x86!


You do need to find a way to download OpenVMS E9.2-3. You can either apply to
the [Ambassador Program](https://vmssoftware.com/products/licenses/) or wait
until the [Hobbyist License Virtual Machine]
(https://vmssoftware.com/community/community-license/) is updated, or, be a
paying customer. The Hobbyist virtual machine includes the C and C++ compiler
and the precompiled binary might work. Give it a try and let me know!

### Follow along and have some compile fun!

You can [download my compiled tetris for OpenVMS x86 binary here](/s/inc/downloads/tetris_openvms_x86.exe).  


Make sure to [have the desktop up and running](/s/blog/OpenVMS_x86_E9.2-3_fixes_CDE_and_adds_Guest_Console.html). 
Open the file manager, navigate to the folder where you've placed the binary and click
it. Have fun playing!


If you want to follow along with compiling, [download the sources for Tetris
here](https://raymii.org/s/inc/downloads/tetris-312.zip). 


I assume that you have a (virtual) machine setup with OpenVMS for the rest of
this article. I'm using the `SYSTEM` user. SSH access is available by default
on these new releases of OpenVMS so you can login with Putty or your favorite
SSH client of choice without any setup hassle.

### Create ISO for file transfer

I had some issues with my friendly local FTP server so I choose to use a
VirtualBox feature to transfer the installation files and sources over to my
OpenVMS Virtual Machine via an ISO. Virtualbox lets you select files and then
automatically makes a (sort of transient) ISO image and couples that. You can
also use FTP or if you have it installed, `curl`. 

![virtualbox iso](/s/inc/img/4897586cb5974a3086ce13359d95f22a.png)

I also added the C and C++ compiler installers and curl. The pre-built
hobbyist VM comes with the C compiler included, but if you don't have that
yet, I used `X86VMS-C-X0706-004-1` (VSI NATIVE C Compiler X7.6-004-1 for
OpenVMS X86 Version V9.2-1 and later). 

Finish the ISO wizard and make sure it is attached in Virtualbox to your
OpenVMS VM.


### Mount ISO in OpenVMS

This is a brief summary, if you want to find out more about the 
[quirks on mounting an ISO on OpenVMS, check out my earlier article](/s/blog/OpenVMS_Mount_ISO_and_execute_scripts.html).

If needed, change your device name (`show devices` for more info) from `DKA0`
to your CD-ROM drive. Mount the disk:

    mount /override=ident dka0
  
Output:

    %MOUNT-I-WRITELOCK, volume is write locked
    %MOUNT-I-CDROM_ISO, OpenVMS-E9.2-3: (1 of 1) , mounted on  _REMY1$DKA0:
  
Navigate to the CDROM mount folder:

    SET DEF REMY1$DKA0:[000000]
  
Check the files in there. My output has the source ZIP, but in earlier
attempts the other files were there as well:
  
    DIR

Output:
  
    Directory REMY1$DKA0:[000000]

    TETRIS312.ZIP;1     TRANS.TBL;1

    Total of 2 files.



### Copy files

The CD-ROM ISO is read only, so extracting the ZIP files will not work. Copy
over the source file to your login folder:

    copy TETRIS312.ZIP;1 SYS$LOGIN

Repeat the process for the product installers, copy those as well. Feel free
to create a different folder to put the files in.


### Install C compiler and curl on OpenVMS

This step is optional if you are using the pre-built hobbyist virtual machine.
My installation did not have the compilers installed so I had to do that.
The curl installer can be [downloaded here](https://vmssoftware.com/products/curl/).
  
Change directory to `SYS$LOGIN` (or the folder you copied the files from the ISO):

    SET DEF SYS$LOGIN
  
Execute the following command to install the C compiler (and in my case, curl):
    
    product install
    
Output:

    _Product name (* to show list): *

Enter `*` to list all installers in this folder. Output:

       1 - VSI X86VMS C X7.6-4                 Layered Product
       2 - VSI X86VMS CURL V8.0-1A             Layered Product
       3 - All products listed above
       ? - Help
       E - Exit

    Choose one or more items from the menu: 3

Enter the number that matches `All products listed above`. In my case `3`. Installation takes a few minutes, output:

        The release notes are located in the file SYS$HELP:CC.RELEASE_NOTES.

        A startup file SYS$STARTUP:DECC$STARTUP.COM has been provided.

          It contains commands which can be executed after the product install
          procedure has been run and at startup to allow for the best compilation
          performance.  You may want to invoke this command file from your
          system's site-specific start up file.  This command file does not
          have to be invoked for correct operation of VSI C.

      VSI X86VMS CURL V8.0-1A

        Post-installation tasks are required.


        To start cURL at system boot time, add the following lines to
        SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM:

          $ file := SYS$STARTUP:CURL$STARTUP.COM
          $ if f$search("''file'") .nes. "" then @'file'

        To stop cURL at system shutdown, add the following lines to
        SYS$MANAGER:SYSHUTDWN.COM:

          $ file := SYS$STARTUP:CURL$SHUTDOWN.COM
          $ if f$search("''file'") .nes. "" then @'file'


### Configure curl on OpenVMS

As indicated by the output of the installer, `curl` requires some
configuration before it can be used. We have to add some commands to the
startup sequence. First make sure the editor knows about your terminal:

    SET TERM/INQUIRE
  
If you don't execute that command, `EDIT` will error and not work:

    %TPU-E-NONANSICRT, SYS$INPUT must be supported CRT

To read more on editting via SSH, [check out my other article](/s/blog/OpenVMS_9.2_for_x86_Getting_Started_part_3.html#toc_0). That article shows you how to edit some other files to make that ` INQUIRE` command no longer needed.

Edit the following file:

    EDIT SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM

Near the bottom, before the exit lines, add the following:

    $ file := SYS$STARTUP:CURL$STARTUP.COM
    $ if f$search("''file'") .nes. "" then @'file'

Save and exit with `CTRL+Z`. For convenience, execute these lines in your
current terminal as well by pasting them. 

To use `curl`, we must define it as a "foreign command", just 
[as we did for zip/unzip](/s/blog/OpenVMS_9.2_for_x86_Getting_Started_part_3.html#toc_1):

    CURL :== $CURL$ROOT:[BIN]CURL.EXE

You can add the `CURL :==...` line at the bottom of your `SYLOGIN.COM` file in
the `SYS$LOGIN` folder to make this permanent.

Test the command to make sure all of the above was done correctly:

    curl --version
  
Output:

    curl 8.0.1 (OpenVMS IA64) libcurl/8.0.1 OpenSSL/1.1.1s zlib/1.2.8 libssh2/1.9.0_
    DEV nghttp2/1.40.90
    Release-Date: May  7 2023
    Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ldap ldaps mq
    tt pop3 pop3s rtsp scp sftp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp
    Features: alt-svc HSTS HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy IPv6 libz NTLM SSL TLS-SRP UnixSockets

Funny how it still says `OpenVMS IA64`. I suspect that is a remnant of the
cross compilation via Itaniums that VSI did to bootstrap OpenVMS on x86.

If you haven't transferred the source code via an ISO, download it with Curl:

    curl -O tetris-312.zip http://raymii.org/s/inc/downloads/tetris-312.zip

### Unzip the source code

With everything installed and configured we can start with the actual fun of trying to compile TETRIS. 

Make sure you have [defined a "foreign command", for unzip](/s/blog/OpenVMS_9.2_for_x86_Getting_Started_part_3.html#toc_1):

    unzip :== $SYS$COMMON:[SYSHLP.UNSUPPORTED.UNZIP]UNZIP.EXE

Start by unzipping the source archive:

    unzip tetris312.zip;1
  
Output: 
  
    Archive:  SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR]TETRIS312.ZIP;1
      inflating: [.tetris_3_1_2]axpobjs.zip
       creating: [.tetris_3_1_2.bm-3d]
      inflating: [.tetris_3_1_2.bm-3d]rot00.xbm
      [...]


Change directory to the unzipped folder:

    set def [.tetris_3_1_2]
    
Check the files:    
  
     DIR

Output:

    Directory SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR.tetris_3_1_2]

You can see that this is old code due to the following lines:

    typedef int size_t;
    ............^
    %CC-E-NOLINKAGE, In this declaration, "size_t" has no linkage and has a prior declaration in this scope at line number 99 in file SYS$COMMON:[SYSLIB]DECC$RTLDEF.TLB;1 (text module
    STDIO).
    at line number 66 in file SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR.tetris_3_1_2]unix_types.h;1


### Fixing the compile errors

If you want to use `vim` for editing instead, [download it from here]
(https://www.polarhome.com/vim/), extract the ZIP file and define a foreign command:
  
    vim :== $SYS$LOGIN:VIM.EXE

After some investigation, I found a few small fixes. The old code defined a lot of its own types
which are now done by the newer compiler by default. We can easily work around that by not including
those custom headers. In the `tetris.h` file comment the following 3 lines:
  
    /* #include        "pwd.h"
    #include        "unix_time.h"
    #include        "unix_types.h" */

Make sure to use `/* ... */` and not `//` to comment. Reason why will become
important later on. Try recompiling now, the errors have greatly reduced:

            strncpy(myscore.myname, (const) vmsusername,vmsuserlen);
        ............................^
        %CC-W-CVTDIFTYPES, In this statement, "(const )vmsusername" of type "int", is being converted to "pointer to const char".
        at line number 193 in file SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR.tetris_3_1_2]tetris.c;2

                myscore.myname[19] = '\0';
        .......................^
        %CC-I-SUBSCRBOUNDS, In this statement, an array is being accessed outside the bounds specified for the array type.
        at line number 437 in file SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR.tetris_3_1_2]tetris.c;2

Those pesky conversion and array bounds checks. If we wanted to write memory-safe
[software we](https://web.archive.org/web/20230701173548/https://enet4.github.io/rust-tropes/rust-evangelism-strike-force/)
[would have used](https://web.archive.org/web/20220815110335/https://kasma1990.gitlab.io/2017/06/25/nobody-expects-the-rust-evangelism-strike-force/)
[Rust](https://web.archive.org/web/20230701173833/http://n-gate.com/hackernews/2017/02/21/0/).
But who worried about that in 1992 when writing a simple Tetris game?

We have a trick up our sleeve. Try compiling with the old `vaxc` standard:

        CC /STANDARD=vaxc tetris.c

No output errors now! I first tried `/STANDARD=relaxed`, but that gave the same errors. If we would have commented with `//` instead of `/*`, that would give a compilation error with this old standard:

    //include        "pwd.h"
    ^
    %CC-E-DECLARATOR, Invalid declarator.
    at line number 35 in file SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR.tetris_3_1_2]tetris.h;11

Continue on with the next source file, that will compile without errors:

    CC /STANDARD=vaxc utils.c

The last file will error out:

    CC /STANDARD=vaxc playing.c

Output:

    static struct timezone tzone = {0, 0};
    ...............................^
    %CC-E-NOINIT, The type of tzone does not permit initialization.
    at line number 46 in file SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR.tetris_3_1_2]playing.c;4


In the file `unix_time.h` there is the following code:

    struct timezone
    {
            int     tz_minuteswest; /* minutes west of Greenwich */
            int     tz_dsttime;     /* type of dst correction */
    };

However, we commented out that header inclusion in `tetris.h`. Edit `tetris.h`
again and paste the above `struct` somewhere on top, below the `X11` includes. Try
compilation again, this time, no errors! 

We're almost finished. You should have 3 `.OBJ` files now.

### Linking tetris on OpenVMS x86

Now that we have `.OBJ` files we must link them. However, that will fail as
well:
    
    LINK tetris,utils,playing
        
Output:

    %ILINK-W-COMPWARN, compilation warnings
            module: TETRIS
            file: SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR.tetris_3_1_2]tetris.OBJ;8
    %ILINK-W-NUDFSYMS, 44 undefined symbols:
    %ILINK-I-UDFSYM,        XALLOCCOLOR
    %ILINK-I-UDFSYM,        XBELL[...]
    %ILINK-I-UDFSYM,        XVISUALIDFROMVISUAL
    %ILINK-W-USEUNDEF, undefined symbol XRMGETFILEDATABASE referenced
            section: $CODE$
            offset: %X0000000000000188
            module: TETRIS
            file: SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR.tetris_3_1_2]tetris.OBJ;8
    %ILINK-W-USEUNDEF, undefined symbol XRMMERGEDATABASES referenced
            section: $CODE$
            offset: %X000000000000019B
            module: TETRIS
            file: SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR.tetris_3_1_2]tetris.OBJ;8
    %ILINK-W-USEUNDEF, undefined symbol XRESOURCEMANAGERSTRING referenced
            section: $CODE$
            offset: %X00000000000001AE
            module: TETRIS
            file: SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR.tetris_3_1_2]tetris.OBJ;8


Just as on Linux  (`-lX11 -lXaw`), we must tell the linker where it can find
the X11 includes. Create the following file:

    EDIT x86.opt

Paste in the following:

    SYS$SHARE:DECW$XTSHR/SHARE
    SYS$SHARE:DECW$XLIBSHR/SHARE

Save with `CTRL+Z`.  Link again, with this file included:

      link tetris,utils,playing,x86.opt/opt

You might receive a warning:

    %ILINK-W-COMPWARN, compilation warnings
        module: TETRIS
        file: SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR.tetris_3_1_2]tetris.OBJ;8

Retry compiling all files and link again. No more errors then!

### Playing Tetris on x86 OpenVMS

After all the hard work, you should now have an `TETRIS.EXE` file:

    dir *.exe

Output:

    Directory SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR.tetris_3_1_2]

    tetris.EXE;7        tetris.EXE;6        tetris.EXE;5        tetris.EXE;4
    tetris.EXE;3        tetris.EXE;2        tetris.EXE;1

    Total of 7 files.
    
I have multiple due to playing around with the code and compiling.

To run tetris, the easiest way is to [use the CDE desktop]
(/s/blog/OpenVMS_x86_E9.2-3_fixes_CDE_and_adds_Guest_Console.html). Open the
file manager, navigate to the Tetris folder and double click the EXE file. 

If you don't want to run CDE, you can also use bare X11 to run just
tetris. Make sure you have an X11 server set up. Execute the following
command:

    SET DISPLAY/CREATE/NODE=<IP of your X11 host>/TRANSPORT=TCPIP/EXEC

Then run TETRIS:

    RUN TETRIS.EXE

Output:        

    GENERIC TETRIS V3.1.2
    Copyright (C) 1992-93      Q. Alex Zhao, azhao@cc.gatech.edu
         GENERIC TETRIS comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

The X11 window should now contain just Tetris, no window borders or anything:

![tetris x11](/s/inc/img/cd325e17d8bd4218bf8c70cfda467168.png)

Have fun beating your highscore!
