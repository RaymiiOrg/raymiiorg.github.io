Recently I had issues updating one of my machines that runs Windows 10. Turns out 
the network firewall was to restrictive. However, the information provided by the
update dialog was just, "Oh, updating failed, maybe try again". Nothing useful,
so I tried to figure out if it's possible to use Powershell for updating. Since
Windows 10 build 1709 Microsoft provides a built in module, but that is not that
user friendly. In this article I'll talk about using `PSWindowsUpdate` and the 
built in Microsoft `WindowsUpdateProvider` to update a Windows 10 machine via 
the command line.

These steps were tested on a Windows 10 machine running build 1703 and one
running 1903. 

The module is not open source and the source is also not available since version 
2 of the module. It is a compiled `.dll` file.

### PSWindowsUpdate vs WindowsUpdateProvider (Install-WUUpdates)

I choose to use this module instead of the `Install-WUUpdates` / `Start-WUScan`
powershell module provided by Microsoft because the machine I was using did not
run build 1709 or later. These microsoft modules are not available on Windows 
10 1703, which the machine ran. Also, the powershell module is way more user 
friendly.

Later I updated the machine to build 1909, after which the modules are available:

    Get-Command -Module WindowsUpdateProvider

Output:

    CommandType     Name                  Version    Source
    -----------     ----                  -------    ------
    [...]
    Function        Install-WUUpdates     1.0.0.2    WindowsUpdateProvider
    Function        Start-WUScan          1.0.0.2    WindowsUpdateProvider

#### Updating with WindowsUpdateProvider

Once you're on a new enough build you can use the following commands to install
updates. Not as verbose and easy to use, but it does not require an external 
module installation. 

Scan for updates and install them, including other microsoft products:

    $Updates = Start-WUScan -SearchCriteria "IsInstalled=0 AND IsHidden=0 AND IsAssigned=1"
    Write-Host "Updates found: " $Updates.Count
    Install-WUUpdates -Updates $Updates

If you want a bit of a progress report or information, you need to write up a
loop yourself. Now back to the `PSWindowsUpdate` module, which features more
information, filtering  and more user friendly features.

### PSWindowsUpdate Installation

Fire up Powershell as an Administrator and install the module with this command:

    Install-Module -Name PSWindowsUpdate -Force

In my case I was asked to update the NUGet modules before the installation started. 
I also had to confirm installation from an untrusted source. Once the module is 
installed you can check the version:

    Get-Package -Name PSWindowsUpdate

Output:

    Name              Version   Source                           ProviderName
    ----              -------   ------                           ------------
    PSWindowsUpdate   2.1.1.2   https://www.powershellgallery... PowerShellGet


Set the execution policy to unrestricted, for the [current process only][1]:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force

Try not to just set the entire execution policy to unrestricted. That feels the 
same as just disabling SELinux.

When you are going to install updates in the future, remember to change the 
the execution policy with this command.

### PSWindowsUpdate Usage

Since the graphical dialog window didn't show my any information on errors or
what went wrong, I was happy to find this module having a `-Verbose` flag. With
that flag I found out the [network firewall][3] was blocking specific requests.
After fixing that, Windows was able to find updates again.

Get a list of available updates:

    Get-WindowsUpdate -MicrosoftUpdate -Verbose

Output:

    VERBOSE: GATEWAY (5-1-2020 13:15:47): Connecting to Microsoft Update server. Please wait...
    VERBOSE: Found [3] Updates in pre search criteria
    VERBOSE: Found [3] Updates in post search criteria

    ComputerName Status     KB          Size Title
    ------------ ------     --          ---- -----
    GATEWAY      -------    KB4533002   63MB 2019-12 Cumulatieve update voor .NET Framework 3.5 en 4.8 voor Windows 10 V...
    GATEWAY      -------    KB2267602  720MB Beveiligingsinformatie-update voor Windows Defender Antivirus - KB2267602 (...
    GATEWAY      -------                 3MB Intel - net - 8/26/2019 12:00:00 AM - 20.70.12.5


Install everything without prompting:

    Install-WindowsUpdate -MicrosoftUpdate -AcceptAll -AutoReboot

Output:

    X ComputerName Result     KB          Size Title
    - ------------ ------     --          ---- -----
    1 GATEWAY      Accepted   KB4533002   63MB 2019-12 Cumulatieve update voor .NET Framework 3.5 en 4.8 voor Windows 10...
    2 GATEWAY      Downloaded KB4533002   63MB 2019-12 Cumulatieve update voor .NET Framework 3.5 en 4.8 voor Windows 10...
    3 GATEWAY      Installed  KB4533002   63MB 2019-12 Cumulatieve update voor .NET Framework 3.5 en 4.8 voor Windows 10...

Everything includes updates for office and other microsoft products. Accept all 
and autoreboot are self-explanatory I think.

If you omit the flags and just use `Install-WindowsUpdate`, it will ask you to 
accept each update and confirm the reboot.

### Extended usage

The module seems to be quite comprehensive, including support for remote 
computers, WSUS servers, uninstalling updates, search filtering and a few more
bits and pieces I have no use for at the moment. [This website][2] describes
the usage in more details. 

For me, just having the commandline to list and install updates was good enough.
