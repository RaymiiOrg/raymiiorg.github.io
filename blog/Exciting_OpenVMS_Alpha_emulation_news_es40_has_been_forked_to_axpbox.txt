Back in 2018 I was playing around with OpenVMS a lot, as it continues on the 
legacy of the PDP-8 and PDP-11. [OpenVMS 7.3 on the VAX emulated via SIMH][1]
runs perfectly, [OpenVMS 8.4 for Alpha was kind of a disaster][2], or, the [es40 
emulator][7] was. Real hardware is available via IslandCo, but shipping to the
Netherlands is horribly expensive.

The only options back then for emulation of Alpha were FreeAXP
or AlphaVM, both paid, closed sourced products with watered down free versions.
Nothing wrong with that, it enables us to play around, and now that OpenVMS
is in the hands of [VMS Software][3] with an x86 port coming along we may
hope for a bright future ahead for OpenVMS. VSI currently provides a 
[hobbyist version][4], but it's a FreeAXP bundle for Windows only. 

Recently I got an email from [Tom&aacute;&scaron;][5] 
regarding his fork of the es40 emulator, [axpbox][6]. This short post
is intended to give this emulator more visibility and exposure, since
I find this to be amazingly cool and exciting. It lists the bugs fixed
and new features, which allow OpenVMS 8.3 and 8.4 to install perfectly.

You can view the [README here][6] and there is an [OpenVMS Installation Guide here][9].
Go download and try it quickly, it's now using cmake, way easier to compile, includes a 
configuration helper and most importantly, the installation of OpenVMS now 
at least works without major errors. Really cool, amazing work by Tomas.

I intend to get back into experimenting with Axpbox and write a few more 
articles on it, including an compilation and installation guide and 
maybe even some clustering if I get around to it.

Here's a screenshot of axpbox running OpenVMS 8.4 right after installing:

and here is me trying to [Mount an ISO with my (expired) hobbyist license][13]:

![axpbox license][12]

The [Expired OpenVMS License PAK][14] is not an issue, since we can just set 
the system date to back when it was still valid. For our hobbyist use I think
that's fine, especially due to the uncertainty regarding the hobbyist program.

To set the system time, use this command: `SET TIME=17-OCT-2018:13:00:00`.

If you are going to install OpenVMS 8.4, do note that it can take quite a long
time. In my case, over 2 hours, but my test hardware is a few years old and
the emulator got one core and 256MB RAM.

Tom&aacute;&scaron; gave permission to quote the email verbatim below.

Hi Remy!

I saw your article on the sad state of Alpha emulators for OpenVMS
some time ago and decided to have a look at es40, thinking it can't be
that bad. After looking at it for a while I decided to fork it and
improve it, the result of which you can see here:

[https://github.com/lenticularis39/axpbox][6]

As of the problems you describe in your article (and the previous one):

- I used a patched version by the YouTube Stephen's Machine Room as
the base instead of the original version
- I changed the build system from autotools to CMake to get rid of
problems with configuring
- I fixed several double free bugs, getting rid of the segmentation
faults (at least those I know of)
- Most importantly I fixed the semaphore error preventing OpenVMS
installation with an IDE controller, making OpenVMS installation much
easier (it was actually possible before, but one had to use the buggy
SCSI controller and hope it won't fail during the installation)

There are of course still many problems with the program (see [Issues
in the repo][10]), to name a few:

- slow serial, probably due to the serial thread sleeping for 20 ms
every cycle
- occasional access violations/memory errors
- incomplete IDE emulation (this makes the OpenBSD installation crash
the emulator, however it shouldn't have any impact on OpenVMS).

So if you want to try running OpenVMS Alpha in an emulator on Linux
again, you can try my fork. I also plan to continue working on it, so
its state will probably improve in the future. (I'm only a computer
science student without much knowledge about Alpha, so my potential
improvements are limited.)
