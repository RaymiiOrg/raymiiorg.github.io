In the book I bought about OpenVMS for [this article on filesystems][3], Getting
Started with OpenVMS by M. Duffy, I've read a few interesting things in the
chapter that introduces user accounts and system login. Namely that a user can
have multiple passwords, that user ID's are not unique and that there can be a
system password. This article goes in to those three topics.

### Add a new user to experiment on

For this article I added a new test user on my OpenVMS 8.4 install. It has the
same privileges as the system user so be carefull with it. Change the root
device and directory if needed:

    
    
     $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
     $ RUN AUTHORIZE
     ADD REMY /PASSWORD=TEMP /OWNER="Remy van Elst" /DEV=DKA0 /DIR=[USERS.REMY] /UIC=[200,201] /FLAG=NODISUSER /PRIV=ALL 
    

Create the home folder for the user and set permissons:

    
    
    $ CREATE /DIRECTORY DKA0:[USERS.REMY]
    $ SET DIRECTORY /OWNER=REMY DKA0:[USERS.REMY]
    

Logout the `SYSTEM` user:

    
    
     $ LOG
    

Login as your new user and change the password (which is `TEMP`):

    
    
       Welcome to OpenVMS (TM) Alpha Operating System, Version V8.4
    
    Your password has expired; you must set a new password to log in
    
    
    New password:
    Verification:
    
    $
    

Try to create a file and see if you setup the folder and permissions correctly:

    
    
    $ dir
    %DIRECT-W-NOFILES, no files found
    $ create example
    hello
    CTRL+Z
    
    $ dir
    
    Directory DKA0:[USERS.REMY]
    
    EXAMPLE.;1
    
    Total of 1 file.
    

Do note that OpenVMS passwords are case-insensitive. [Read here][5] for more
information, there is a flag you can toggle to make passwords case sensitive.

> A user password can contain up to 32 alphanumeric and special characters.
Unless your system manager has set the PWDMIX flag in your authorization account
record, the only special characters permitted are the dollar sign and
underscore. Without the PWDMIX authorization, all lowercase characters are
converted to uppercase before the password is encrypted. For example, "eagle" is
the same as "EAGLE."

Furthermore, spaces are ignored:

> Blank spaces are permissible within a password, but they are not considered
part of the password, and OpenVMS ignores them. For example, "MY PASSWORD" is an
acceptable password, but the system only records "MYPASSWORD." This means that
"MYPA SSWORD" is also a valid password for the account in question.

#### Licensing error?

After adding the user and trying to login I got a licensing error:

    
    
    No license is active for this software product
    

It also spammed the terminal with AUDIT server logs:

    
    
    %%%%%%%%%%%  OPCOM  10-MAY-2018 19:52:05.87  %%%%%%%%%%%
    Message from user AUDIT$SERVER on REMY1
    Security alarm (SECURITY) and security audit (SECURITY) on REMY1, system id: 104

    PID:                      0000021C
    Process name:             REMY
    Username:                 REMY
    Process owner:            [REMY]
    Terminal name:            _TTA0:
    Image name:               REMY1$DKA0:[SYS0.SYSCOMMON.][SYSEXE]LOGINOUT.EXE
    Posix UID:                -2
    Posix GID:                -2 (%XFFFFFFFE)
    Status:                   %LICENSE-F-NOLICENSE, no license is active for this software product
    

Somehow all my licenses disappeared:

    
    
    $ SHOW LICENSE /USAGE
    
    View of loaded licenses from node REMY1                 10-MAY-2018 19:58:37.10
    %SHOW-I-NOLICENSE, no licenses exist
    

After re-adding my hobbyist license it still did not work. I had to add the
hostname (`REMY1`) for the error to go away:

    
    
    $ LICENSE MODIFY OPENVMS-ALPHA /INCLUDE=REMY1
    

After which all was well and I could login with the new user:

    
    
    $ SHOW LICENSE OPENVMS-ALPHA
    
    Active licenses on node REMY1:
    
    ------- Product ID --------    ---- Rating ----- -- Version --
    Product            Producer    Units Avail Activ Version Release    Termination
    OPENVMS-ALPHA      DEC             0  0     100    0.0  (none)       1-APR-2019
    

Unsure why this happens. Now let's get on to the exciting stuff.

### Secondary password

The first thing I want to cover is the secondary password. A user account on
OpenVMS can have more than 1 password, the main password and the secondary
password. This can be usefull in high-security environments where two people are
needed to access a user account (that could have special privileges). Read more
on UIC codes in [the documentation][6].

Chapter 4, User accounts, Overview states:

> Your system manager may create user accounts that require zero, one, or two
passwords, but accounts with one password are the norm.

From [the documentation][7]: 

> Secondary password. The second of two passwords to be entered for an account
requiring both primary and secondary passwords. The secondary password provides
an additional level of security on user accounts. Typically, the primary user
does not know the secondary password; a supervisor or other key person must be
present to supply it. For certain applications, the supervisor may also decide
to remain present while the account is in use. Thus, secondary passwords
facilitate controlled logins and the actions taken after a login. Secondary
passwords can be time-consuming and inconvenient. They are justified only at
sites with maximum security requirements. An example of an account that
justifies dual passwords would be one that bypasses normal access controls to
permit emergency repair to a database.

The text above already gives an example and I can imagine a few more. Take two
users of different functions in the organization, say a programmer and a
director. If the sysadmins are not available (hit by a bus, holiday) these two
users can gain access to a special account to do maintenance. In other operating
systems you can achieve this by giving either one a part of the password. The
OpenVMS way feels more thought out since you can check which accounts require
secondary passwords and the different password attempts are logged as well.

To set up a secondary password, open the `AUTHORIZATION` program and use
`MODIFY`.

    
    
     $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
     $ RUN AUTHORIZE
     MODIFY REMY /PASSWORD=("", example) /NOPWDEXPIRED
    

The first user password is not modified, hence the `("",`. If you want to modify
both passwords, replace the `""` with a password. If you have a user with two
passwords and want to modify only the first password, use `/PASSWORD=example`.
To modify both passwords, `/PASSWORD=(FIRST_PASS, SECONDARY_PASS)`.

The `/NOPWDEXPIRED` flag is set because otherwise the user would have to change
the secondary password at first login and in the use case of a secondary
password that is not what you want (since it involves two users).

If you logout (`LOG`) and login as the user, you will be asked for a password
twice. The first prompt is for the first password, the second for the secondary
password:

    
    
     Welcome to OpenVMS (TM) Alpha Operating System, Version V8.4
    
    Username: remy
    Password:
    Password:
       Welcome to OpenVMS (TM) Alpha Operating System, Version V8.4
        Last interactive login on Friday, 11-MAY-2018 20:20:33.58
    
    $
    

To remove a secondary password, remove all passwords from a user and set a new
password:

    
    
    $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
    $ RUN AUTHORIZE
    UAF> MODIFY REMY /NOPASSWORD
    %UAF-I-PWDLESSMIN, new password is shorter than minimum password length
    %UAF-I-MDFYMSG, user record(s) updated
    UAF> MODIFY REMY /PASSWORD=TEMP
    %UAF-I-MDFYMSG, user record(s) updated
    

When the user logs in now, it will require one password and the user has to
change that after first login.

You can read more on the `AUTHORIZE` program [here][8].

### User ID's (UIC) are not unique

The second interesting point I want to show and talk about is the `UIC`
uniqueness. Linux has the `UID` and `GID`, OpenVMS combines them into one
number. A UIC consists of: `GROUP,MEMBER` and has the form of `[200,201]`. Group
ID 200, User (member) ID 201. System users have a `UID` below 10 (by default).
UIC codes can be both numeric as in these examples as well as alphanumeric
(`[WELDING,JACK]`).

Chapter 4, User Identification Code (UIC), states:

> UICs Are Not Necessarily Unique It is important to note that a UIC does not
necessarily identify one particular user. It is possible for the system manager
to assign the same UIC to two or more user accounts. It is also possible to
reuse a UIC previously assigned to a user account that has been deleted.

File protection (not ACL's) relies on User Identification Codes, thus a system
manager can choose to create a user with the same UIC as another user. (Not the
same username though). This way one account that is not a privileged account can
access the files of another user without special permissions, since for the
system it is the same UIC.

You might use this when someone is away for a longer period, or when a user is
replaced by someone else. In Linux systems, the UID is recommended to be unique,
but it is not required. In my experience however it gives more problems than
solutions and using groups, SElinux or ACL's will fix your problem better.

I cover this because as far as I know now, in OpenVMS, the file protection bits
are exclusively looking at the UIC. I'm not sure how that is on a linux system.

Earlier in the article we created a new user with the UIC `[200,201]`. Let's
create an example file and make that not accessible for other users:

    
    
    $ CREATE EXAMP.TXT
    this is a test
     CTRL+Z
    

Check the default permissions:

    
    
    $ DIR /SECURITY
    
    Directory DKA0:[USERS.REMY]
    
    EXAMP.TXT;1          [REMY]                           (RWED,RWED,RE,)
    
    Total of 1 file.
    

This means that:

  * System: read, write, execute, delete
  * Owner: read, write, execute, delete
  * Group: read, execute
  * World: none

Change it so that the group to which the user belongs (201) also cannot access
the file:

    
    
    $ SET FILE/PROTECTION=(S:RWED,O:RWED,G,W) EXAMP.TXT;1
    

Now create another user with a different UIC to test the rights. Make sure it
has no system permissions otherwise it will still be able to access the file.

    
    
     $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
     $ RUN AUTHORIZE
     ADD REMY2 /PASSWORD=TEMP /OWNER="Remy2" /DEV=DKA0 /DIR=[USERS.REMY2] /UIC=[300,401] /FLAG=NODISUSER 
     CTRL+Z ! to exit UAF>
    
    $ CREATE /DIRECTORY DKA0:[USERS.REMY2]
    $ SET DIRECTORY /OWNER=REMY2 DKA0:[USERS.REMY2]
    

Login as that user (`REMY2`) and check if you can access that file. It should
fail:

    
    
    $ TYPE DKA0:[USERS.REMY]EXAMP.TXT;1
    %TYPE-W-OPENIN, error opening DKA0:[USERS.REMY]EXAMP.TXT;1 as input
    -RMS-E-PRV, insufficient privilege or file protection violation
    

Cool. Now, as the system user, run `AUTHORIZE` and change the UIC code of this
second user. Note, don't do this on a live system since it can have unwanted
side-effects (namely permission errors for all your users files).

    
    
    UAF> MODIFY REMY2 /UIC=[200,201]
    
    %UAF-E-RDBMDFYERR, unable to modify identifier REMY2
    -SYSTEM-F-DUPIDENT, duplicate identifier
    %UAF-I-MDFYMSG, user record(s) updated
    

Disregard the error, check with `SHOW REMY2` to see the actual change:

    
    
    UAF> SHOW REMY2
    
    Username: REMY2                            Owner:  Remy2
    Account:                                   UIC:    [200,201] ([REMY])
    CLI:      DCL                              Tables: DCLTABLES
    Default:  DKA0:[USERS.REMY2]
    LGICMD:
    Flags:
    

Log back in as that user (`REMY2`). The file of the different user with the same
UIC (`REMY`) should be readable now:

    
    
    $ TYPE DKA0:[USERS.REMY]EXAMP.TXT;1
    this is a test
    

As well as the home folder of the user:

    
    
    $ DIR DKA0:[USERS.REMY]
    
    Directory DKA0:[USERS.REMY]
    
    EXAMP.TXT;1
    
    Total of 1 file.
    

However, as stated above, you won't be able to view your own files and folders
anymore, since your UIC changed:

    
    
    $ SHOW DEF
      DKA0:[USERS.REMY2]
    $ DIR
    %DIRECT-E-OPENIN, error opening DKA0:[USERS.REMY2]*.*;* as input
    -RMS-E-PRV, insufficient privilege or file protection violation
    

### System password

The last of the interesting bits I want to discuss is the system password.

Chapter 5, logging in and out of the system, the login sequence states:

> Some OpenVMS systems have a system password enabled. This is a rarely used,
extra security feature. Such systems require you to type a password, which will
not be displayed, even before presenting you with a Username: prompt. You will
have no indication that anything at all is happening until the system password
is accepted.

From [the documentation][7]:

> The System password controls access to particular terminals and is required at
the discretion of the security administrator. System passwords are usually
necessary to control access to terminals that might be targets for unauthorized
use, such as dialup and public terminal lines.

To setup the system password, set the password and then choose the terminals
where you want to require the system password.

Start up `AUTHORIZE`:

    
    
     $ SET DEFAULT SYS$SYSTEM
     $ RUN AUTHORIZE
    

Set the password:

    
    
    UAF> MODIFY/SYSTEM_PASSWORD=example
    %UAF-I-SYSPWDMOD, system password modified
    

Then on a terminal where you want to require the system password, execute this
command:

    
    
    $ SET TERMINAL/SYSPWD/PERMANENT
    

You can use the `SHOW TERM` command to check if the password is active. Look for
`Syspassword`.

    
    
    $ SHOW TERM
    Terminal: _TTA0:      Device_Type: Unknown       Owner: _TTA0:
                                                  Username: SYSTEM
    
       Input:    9600     LFfill:  0      Width:  80      Parity: None
       Output:   9600     CRfill:  0      Page:   24

[The [documentation][9] [states that you can require this for remote logins, but
I have trouble getting [the networking part working, due to issues with Windows
10\. No way for me to [test that yet.

This is a GIF I recorded with the Windows On Screen Keyboard to show that the
system password is required before being able to do anything:
