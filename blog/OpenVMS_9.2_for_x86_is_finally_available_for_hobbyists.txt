OpenVMS x86 is now available for (most) hobbyists! Almost a year after [the official release](/s/blog/OpenVMS_9.2_for_x86_will_be_released_tomorrow.html) most hobbyists can now login to the [Service Portal](https://sp.vmssoftware.com) to download their copy of OpenVMS 9.2 for x86, `X86E921OE.ZIP` and the PAK (license) files (`x86community-20240401.zip`), valid until April 2024.

### OpenVMS 9.2 for Hobbyists

This is just a quick blog post to notify people of the availability for hobbyists
registered in the VMS Software INC program. I received an email from another 
hobbyist notifying me of the release and where to download it, using my existing
credentials for the hobbyist program:

> Hello,
> Letting you know, from one hobbyist to another, that VSI has started rolling
  out OpenVMS for hobbyists slowly. You don't need to re-register from the
  Community license website if you have a license for Alpha/Integrity already,
  but if you didn't get an email yet (they're releasing it out in batches) you
  can try to log in manually in [https://sp.vmssoftware.com](3)  (yes, they shifted
  the community program into the Service Platform for downloads as well.
  Hooray, no more slow SFTP downloads!) Try the email you used to enter an
  Alpha/Integrity community license. If it says "invalid password", reset your
  password and you should be able to get in early (worked for me, even though I
  didn't get the email yet). If it says that your user can't be found, wait for
  an email. Cheers!


I've downloaded the C++ compiler and [the OpenVMS WEBUI][4], can't wait to
get started. Expect more posts on OpenVMS x86 on this site in the future!


Here is a screenshot of the downloads available:

### No XSAVE instruction available

<s>I'm not able to provide a full guide right now, but</s> my installation fails
due to Hyper-V being active and Virtualbox / OpenVMS not liking that:

![xsave][6]

It seems that [disabling Hyper-V][7] resolves this error, but disabling it 
makes WSL (Windows subsystem for Linux) not work anymore, which I do require
for work-related tasks.

<s>Will post an update soon though!</s>


### Getting Started with OpenVMS 9.2 guide

Update: the first part of my [Getting Started][8] guide is finished, read 
that to see how to install OpenVMS on VirtualBox.
