![owncloud][1]

I keep a few servers around for shared webhosting for friends, family and some
other domains. Most of them run Directadmin, because it is easier to work with
for the target audience. I'm very good with the command line, they've never
heard of it.

One of my friends runs Owncloud, a wonderfull piece of software to get cloud
services under your control. He does not use the file part but rather the
calendar and contacts a lot. A recent update of Apache to 2.4.10 broke that
functionality on a Directadmin machine with the error AH01797: client denied by
server configuration.

I started by checking the vhosts file,
`/usr/local/directadmin/data/users/$USER/httpd.conf` and see if changing or
adding the `Require all granted` part solved it. But, it did not.

A combination of `httpd -S` to see all sites and `httpd -V` to see all compile
settings led me to a Directadmin configuration file, `/etc/httpd/conf/extra
/httpd-directories.conf` which contains the following:

    
    
    <Directory /home>
            AllowOverride All
            Options -MultiViews -Indexes +FollowSymLinks +IncludesNoExec +Includes
            <Limit GET POST OPTIONS PROPFIND>
                    Order allow,deny
                    Allow from all
            </Limit>
           <LimitExcept GET POST OPTIONS PROPFIND>
                   Order deny,allow
                   Deny from all
           </LimitExcept>
    </Directory>
    

The [PROPFIND][3] HTTP method is specific to Webdav, Owncloud used that a lot
with Carddav and Caldav sync. Commenting out or removing the `PROPFIND` method
from the last `Deny from all` block solved the syncing problem. I'm not sure how
that got in there, it seems incorrect with 2.4, but still, after removing it,
Owncloud works as it did again.
