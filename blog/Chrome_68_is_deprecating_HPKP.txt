### HPKP removed from Chrome 68

![][1]

In 2014 I [published an article on HPKP][2], http public key pinning. It allows
a site operator to send a public key in an http header, forcing the browser to
only connect when that header is found. It was ment to redice the risk of a
compromised certificate authority (since any CA can create a certificate for any
website). Quite secure, but it was often wrongly configured, forgotten until
certificates expired and there were some security issues like a false pin. Late
2017 Google announced that HPKP would be removed in Chrome 68 and that version
is released now, so HPKP is no longer supported.

A certificate authority, like Comodo, because they are trusted by every browser, can issue a certificate for any site (so google.com, raymii.org). But, the Netherlands Government ([Staat der Nederlanden][3]) or the [Hong Kong Post office][4] (China government) are trusted as well, thus are also able to issue a certificate for google.com. Now, there are all kinds of rules prohibiting that, but as [I've shown][5] by getting a certificate for a website I don't own, just as [this guy for Microsoft Live.fi][6], that it is prohibited by rules doesn't mean it is not technically possible. HPKP was meant to prevent that, by hardcoding a certificate for your site into a browser.

The [Google development announcement can be found here][8], where they describe
and discuss the intent to remove the feature from chrome.

[ZDNET][9] has an article going into more detail on what goes wrong when you
forgot about Key Pinning when a certificate expires:

> This scenario happened to [Smashing Magazine][10] when it was updating an
expiring SSL certificate. It enabled HPKP and set the policy for 365 days. After
rolling out new valid certificates, all browsers with the old HPKP policy
couldn't visit the site. Also, the new HPKP policy did nothing to update the old
one.

### Replacement for HPKP, Expect-CT header?

Google wants the [Expect-CT][11] header to replace HPKP. This header allows web
host operators to instruct user agents (browsers) to expect valid Signed
Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) to be served on connections to these hosts. When
configured in enforcement mode, user agents (UAs) will remember that hosts
expect SCTs and will refuse connections that do not conform to the UAs
Certificate Transparency policy.

There is no automatic detection of invalid certificates or rouge certificates.
As far as I understand you must configure and monitor the CT logs yourself to
find rouge certificates. I use [this site][12] and get emails when a certificate
for a certain domain is found.

[This page][13] has a little bit more on the replacement:

> By combining Expect-CT with active monitoring for relevant domains, which a
growing number of CAs and third-parties now provide, site operators can
proactively detect misissuance in a way that HPKP does not achieve, while also
reducing the risk of misconfiguration and avoiding the risk of hostile pinning,
(Chris) Palmer said.

Google's Certificate Transparency project is an open framework for monitoring
and auditing SSL certificates. The goal behind the project is detection of mis-
issued/malicious certificates and identification of rogue Certificate
Authorities.

Read more about the [Expect-CT header in the RFC][14]. To read more about
Certificate Transparency, [check the site here][15].

As I'm unsure on how the actual header works, for example what defines when an
error is given, I'm not recommending it yet, until I've done more research.

### Removing HPKP on raymii.org

I removed HPKP about half a year ago from the servers [hosting raymii.org][16].
First by setting the `max-age` portion of the header to `0`, that tells existing
browsers that have HPKP cached to invalidate the known time. Otherwise, when
changing the certificate, the browser would still have old information thus
giving errors.

After 4 months, I actually changed the webserver configuration to remove the
HPKP headers:

    
    
    $ curl -I https://raymii.org
    HTTP/2 200 
    server: nginx/1.10.3 (Ubuntu)
    date: Tue, 12 Jun 2018 09:39:01 GMT
    content-type: text/html
    content-length: 376

    expires: Thu, 12 Jul 2018 09:39:01 GMT
    cache-control: max-age=2592000
    strict-transport-security: max-age=63072000; includeSubdomains; preload
    referrer-policy: origin
    x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block
    coffee: Black
    tea: Earl-Gray; Hot
    x-frame-options: DENY
    x-content-type-options: nosniff
    x-ua-compatible: IE=Edge,chrome=1
    cache-control: public
    accept-ranges: bytes
    

As you can see, no `Public-Key-Pins` header. If you have HPKP and want to remove
it, make sure to first set the time to `0` and let that run for a few months.
