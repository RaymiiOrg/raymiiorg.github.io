Recently I discovered a firefox extension that converts any website 
into a dark version. Works both on firefox for mobile and on the desktop (and
all other major browsers), is open source, causes less strain on the eyes and 
improves battery life. Just as the earlier post on Blokada, I find this such
a cool piece of software I wanted to share it with all my readers.

### Dark Reader

For a few websites I had to disable the extension which is made easy in via the
extensions button in the browser. It seems my battery life improved on android,
but that is so subjective I'm hesitant to state it. However, a bright white pixel
uses more energy than a dark pixel, especially on an OLED screen so there is a
theory there.

You can view the source code [on github][3] and if you like the extension you
can [donate to them via OpenCollective here][4]. You do need NodeJS to build
the extension but it's documented clearly. The documentation seems to be quite
comprehensive so that's always a great thing for a project.
