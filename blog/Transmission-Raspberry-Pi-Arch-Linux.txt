![transmission][1]

One of my Raspberry Pi's was running a test setup of the Citadel groupware
service. The test was sucessfull, so I set up a real world setup. The Raspberry
Pi would serve another purpose, namely, a Linux Torrent seedbox. As in, to seed
Linux torrents from [linuxtracker.org][2].

I choose Transmission for this, because it is simple, fast and stable.
Transmission has a good webinterface, plus it allows access from remote clients
with the transmission-remote gui packages.

My Pi's run Arch Linux, so setup of Transmission is fairly easy. First install
it with pacman:

    
    
    sudo pacman -Syu transmission-cli
    

Enable the service at startup:

    
    
    sudo systemctl enable transmission
    

Start the service:

    
    
    sudo systemctl start transmission
    

Create a folder where your user and the transmission group (where the
transmission user belongs to) can read and write:

    
    
    sudo mkdir -p /mnt/data/torrents/{incomplete,complete,torrentfiles}
    sudo chown -R remy:transmission /mnt/data/torrents
    sudo chmod -R 775 /mnt/data/torrents
    

In my example the folder `/mnt/data/torrents` is an external USB harddrive which
is mounted via `/etc/fstab` at boot. Remember to change `remy` to your Pi
username.

Stop the daemon to make sure the config file edits stick:

    
    
    sudo systemctl stop transmission
    

Edit the default config file to allow remote access to the daemon (or do not do
that and use an ssh tunnel every time) and update the downloads path:

    
    
    sudo vim /var/lib/transmission/.config/transmission-daemon/settings.json
    

Change the following parameters:

    
    
        # From
        "download-dir": "/var/lib/transmission/Downloads",
        # To
        "download-dir": "/mnt/data/torrents/complete",
    
        # From:
        "incomplete-dir": "/var/lib/transmission/Downloads",
        # To
        "incomplete-dir": "/mnt/data/torrents/incomplete",
    
        # From
        "incomplete-dir-enabled": false,
        # To
        "incomplete-dir-enabled": true,
    
        # From
        "rpc-whitelist": "127.0.0.1",
        # To
        "rpc-whitelist": "*.*.*.*",
    

This sets the correct download folders and allows access from everywhere to the
transmission webinterface. You can also list a range there (192.168.1.0/24) or
just one IP address.

If you do not udate the ACL you get a nice error message when connecting:

    
    
    403: Forbidden
    
    Unauthorized IP Address.
    
    Either disable the IP address whitelist or add your address to it.
    
    If you're editing settings.json, see the 'rpc-whitelist' and 'rpc-whitelist-enabled' entries.
    
    If you're still using ACLs, use a whitelist instead. See the transmission-daemon manpage for details.
    

If all went well you should be able to connect to `http://YOUR-PI-IP:9091` and
see the nice transmission webinterface.
