I'm pleased to announce the next version of Leaf Node Monitoring, the simple and easy to use open source site and server monitoring tool. This update adds two features users have requested, plus a couple of small but useful fixes. This post goes over everything that is new in this release.

This post is cross-posted on [the official Leaf Node Monitoring]
(https://www.leafnode.nl/news/leaf-node-monitoring-v2025-01-released-with-import-export-and-connectivity-check/)
website.

[You can download the new version here.](https://www.leafnode.nl/download)


This is the first release that will not be available on the Google Play store, 
[see this post for details](https://www.leafnode.nl/news/leaf-node-monitoring-will-be-removed-from-the-google-play-store-due-to-googles-new-policies/). 
The download still includes an APK file so you can still use it on Android.


**Leaf Node Monitoring v2025.02** is now available for download and as a free
  upgrade for previous customers. New features include import and export
  of checks and settings and a connectivity check, as well as other
  various small bug fixes.



### Import and Export

You can now export and import all your hosts, checks, and settings directly
from the Settings screen. Handy if you want to back things up or move your
setup to another machine. The file format is base64-encoded JSON so you can
easily take a look at it.


### Internet Connectivity Check

![connectibity check](/s/inc/img/connectivity_check.png)

Leaf Node Monitoring can now tell you when your internet connection goes down,
even if your local network is still up. It checks a few public endpoints like
`connectivitycheck.gstatic.com`, `ping.archlinux.org`, and a few others. If
you don't want this, you can disable it in the settings. Checks are not
disabled when an offline situation is detected.

## Other changes

I fixed a bug where the "update available" message showed up even when you
were offline. There are a few Qt6 fixes, I'm now using Qt 6.8 for the Qt6
build (previous was Qt 6.4). 
Also, there's a small easter egg in this release -- let me know if you find it.


### Leaf Node Monitoring v2025.01 is now available

This release is no longer available via the Google Play Store.
If you purchase via the website you can choose your own price.
You get an archive with a Windows Installer, a Linux AppImage, the source
code and an Android APK. 
[Leaf Node Monitoring is able to export it's own source code](https://www.leafnode.nl/source-code/)
, so you are able to compile for other platforms if you wish.
