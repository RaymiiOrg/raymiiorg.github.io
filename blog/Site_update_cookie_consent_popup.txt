A small site update this time, just to let you know that I've added a cookie consent popup to this static site. If you reject all cookies, you should not see any advertisements and aren't tracked by Google Analytics. It's open source, cookieconsent by Orest Bida.

**Update: 16-04-2023: The cookie popup and all google ads are removed.**

This is a static site, meaning that there is no server-side language 
like PHP or Ruby or Python involved, just plain old HTML files. I 
write my articles in markdown and have a custom static site generator
that I wrote [in python][3] that turns those markdown articles into
this beautiful site. 

I also try to stay away from JavaScript as much as possible. In the past
the Table of Contents in each article was generated using JavaScript but
I changed that a while ago and now the Python script does that. 

However, for the Cookie Consent popup, there was no getting around using
some JavaScript, but fear not, I'm using an open source cookie consent
popup, [cookieconsent by Orest Bida][1]. Only after a user gives permission
the analytics and advertisements are loaded. Try it for yourself, only
after you permit access, should you start to see advertisements.


Below are two screenshots showing the popup and the settings screen:
