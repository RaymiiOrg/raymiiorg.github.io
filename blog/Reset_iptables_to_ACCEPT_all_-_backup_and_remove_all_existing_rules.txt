Here's a small bash script that removes all `iptables` rules and sets up a
default ACCEPT ALL state. Before the reset, it creates a backup of the current
rules. I use this often to troubleshoot servers with networking issues. If you
just blindly do an `iptables -F` you might lock yourself out of a server since
the INPUT policy might be DROP.

Save the script to something like `iptables-reset.sh` and run it:

    
    
    #!/bin/bash
    set -x # Echo
    set -e # Stop on error
    set -o noclobber # Dont overwrite files with redirection
    
    iptables-save > iptables.$(date +%s)
    
    echo "iptables saves to iptables.$(date +%s)"
    
    iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
    iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
    iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
    iptables -F
    iptables -X
    iptables -t nat -F
    iptables -t nat -X
    iptables -t mangle -F
    iptables -t mangle -X
    iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
    iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
    iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
    
        echo done
    

It will not only save the current rules, but it will also echo out all the
commands so you can see what happened in your terminal history.
