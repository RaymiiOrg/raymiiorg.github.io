Someone [liked my Reddit post][1] regarding a few old CD's I found of Caldera
Openlinux 1.2, including source code and floppies so much they gilded it. I got
some special internet points today.

Look at that bright yellow star.

Reddit even messaged me to let me know I got gold.

I'll have to go look for a CD drive, since I don't have any at hand, but I will
try to upload these CD's to Archive.org as requested in the reddit thread.
