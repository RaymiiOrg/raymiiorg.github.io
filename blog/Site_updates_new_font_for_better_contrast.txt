### A small site update

New year, time for some site updates. This site is generated with my
self-written open source static site generator named [ingsoc][9] (named after
1984) and this update is a collection of  small improvements. A new font, 
internal code updates to the generator and a few CSS fixes here and there.

I sometimes write updates on new changes in ingsoc, those articles can be
found   [here][7]. The last site update was [about the costs to run
Raymii.org][6]. If you read these site update articles, please [let me
know][8]. I'd like to hear your opinion on the new layout.

### New font: Ubuntu instead of Raleway

Most notably I've switched fonts, I'm now using Ubuntu instead of Raleway. One 
of the complaints I got often was the readability / contrast on the site and 
I do agree that Raleway was quite thin. I like the Ubuntu font as well and 
that is thicker, so I hope it provides better contrast. Please let me know!

The code blocks are still monospace Roboto, since I like that font as well. 
One of the small CSS improvements is that the indentation on the first line 
of a code block is now gone. 

The link to the [Cluster Status][1] page, which is a fancy live interactive
monitor, is now added to the top as well. I had to scroll down way too often.

### Screenshots, before and after
