I've made some new improvements to this website. Raymii.org is generated using
my self-written static site generator named ingsoc, the new features are
focussed on accessibility. If you are using a screen reader or command-line
browser this will benefit you. Or if you like to archive stuff offline. The two
main improvements are a text-only version of every content page
(article/tutorial etc) and a 'Skip to main content' link.

[Three months ago I also did some site [updates][1]

### Skip to main content

If you visit this site using a screen reader (like Orca) or a command line
browser like `links` the first thing on every page is a link to skip to the main
content. Saves you going through the menu every time.

The W3C has a page on this: [G1: Adding a link at the top of each page that goes
directly to the main content area][3] on their Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines.

### Text only versions of content

Also in the context of accessibility, every content page has a text-only
version. There is a link at the top of every article, near the breadcrumb where
the author and date of the article are listed. It will take you to a text-only
version of the article. _Replacing`.html` with `.txt` in the URL will also
work._

The text-only articles are the raw markdown I write and which the static site
generator uses to generate this site. As my main goal is spreading knowledge and
entertaining fellow nerds, I want this site to get readers.

When I'm no longer around I hope this site is archived by many people (git repo
[here][6] and the [web archive.org here][7]) and the knowledge and posts are
retained for later generations.

Just as I enjoy [old DEC documents][8]. And what file format is better than
simple text? This fancy HTML and javascript might not be readable in the future,
but my guess is that `.txt` will remain longer than the current
javascript/browser trend, probably even longer than me.
