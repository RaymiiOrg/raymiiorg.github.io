This is a static site, meaning that no server-side processing occurs. All HTML is generated out of a few folders full of markdown source and then uploaded to the cluster. Searching on this site was always provided by a text-box form that sent you to google with 'site:raymii.org' appended to it. Works fine, but it sends all data to Google. With my recent removal of all Google Ads on this site, as well as tracking via Google Analytics, sending searches via Google seems wrong. <br/><br/>I recently found the `pagefind` program which I now use on here, it is a self hosted static site search engine of sorts.

Pagefind is [written][8] [in][9] [Rust][10] and runs after my static site generator binary.
`pagefind` indexes all generated HTML and provides an API to query that,
including a search UI which you can see at the bottom of every page here.
Perfect for my static site setup and it aims to not use much storage or
bandwidth.

The search box used to look like this:

![old search img][3]

When you entered a term and pressed `ENTER` you were sent to Google:

![old search via Google][4]



Now the search box looks like this:

![new search box][5]

I know, it's such a major change! Searching is instant and shows the results 
right on the page:

![new search results][6]


**Notable changes include thumbnails and publication dates**. I have not done
any configuration whatsoever for the thumbnails, it just figured that out
by itself. Cool!


### What is pagefind?

Quoting the [pagefind website][1]:


> Pagefind is a fully static search library that aims to perform well on large
  sites, while using as little of your users' bandwidth as possible, and
  without hosting any infrastructure.

> Pagefind runs after Hugo, Eleventy, Jekyll, Next, Astro, SvelteKit, or any
  other SSG. The installation process is always the same: Pagefind only
  requires a folder containing the built static files of your website, so in
  most cases no configuration is needed to get started.

> After indexing, Pagefind adds a static search bundle to your built files,
  which exposes a JavaScript search API that can be used anywhere on your site.
  Pagefind also provides a prebuilt UI that can be used with no configuration
  (you can see the prebuilt UI at the top of this page).

> The goal of Pagefind is that websites with tens of thousands of pages should
  be searchable by someone in their browser, while consuming a reasonable
  amount of bandwidth. Pagefind's search index is split into chunks, so that
  searching in the browser only ever needs to load a small subset of the search
  index. Pagefind can run a full-text search on a 10,000 page site with a total
  network payload under 300KB, including the Pagefind library itself. For most
  sites, this will be closer to 100KB.



In my case this site has 489 articles as of the time this page was written. The
search index is around 5MB in size (files on the filesystem, this includes a 
webassembly runtime).


Using the firefox devtools network tab performance analyzer I can see that 
searching for the term `QObject` uses around 250kB, excluding the images:

![search usage][7]


This matches the statement above regarding network payload. The search term
`QObject` returns 8 results currently.
