Using [this guide][3] I was able to install OpenVMS 7.3 for VAX on simh on
Ubuntu 16.04.

This is a copy-paste of my terminal for future reference. This is not one of my
usual articles, a guide with comprehensive information an background. Just a log
of my terminal.

        The OpenVMS Management Station is a client-server application that
        provides OpenVMS system management capabilities through a client
        application on a personal computer (PC) running Microsoft Windows.
    
        The server application runs on OpenVMS systems and is automatically
        installed as part of the OpenVMS operating system.
    
        This option provides the files used to install the PC client software.
        If you want to use the OpenVMS Management Station, you must install
        these optional files on at least one OpenVMS system and then use one or
        both of them to install the PC client on one or more PCs.  There are two
        files:  TNT030_I.EXE for Intel systems (Windows 95 and Windows NT), and
        TNT030_A.EXE for Alpha Windows NT systems.
    
        The OpenVMS Management Station optional files consume approximately 20000
        blocks and will be placed on your system disk in SYS$COMMON:[TNT.CLIENT].
    
    * Do you want to install the optional OpenVMS Management Station files? (Y/N) n
    
        You can select DECwindows now, or you can use the DECW$TAILOR utility
        to provide or remove DECwindows support after the installation.
    
        Some media, TK50s in particular, can be very slow when tailoring on files.
        You might want to select DECwindows now and tailor off unwanted files later.
    
        NOTE: This kit does NOT contain full DECwindows.
              To obtain full DECwindows, you must also install the separate
              layered product, DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX.
              V1.2-3 is the minimum version of DECwindows Motif for OpenVMS VAX
              that can be used with OpenVMS VAX V7.3.
    
        The DECwindows components provided in this kit requires approximately
        34400 blocks, broken down as follows:
    
            o DECwindows base support                    -   4400 blocks
            o DECwindows workstation support             -  23800 blocks
              -  75 dots per inch video fonts            -    (included)
              - 100 dots per inch video fonts (optional) -   6200 blocks
    
        You must select the DECwindows base support option if
            - you plan to run DECwindows software, or
            - you are installing this kit on
                * a workstation or
                * an OpenVMS Cluster that contains workstations, or
            - you want to provide font files for Xterminals.
    
        If you are installing this kit on a system that includes Xterminals
        and you do NOT select DECwindows base support, then you will have to use
        the DECW$TAILOR utility to provide font files.
    
    * Do you want the DECwindows base support? (Y/N) y
    
        Space remaining:  2203591 blocks

                * an OpenVMS Cluster that contains workstations, or
            - you want to provide font files for Xterminals.
    
        If you are installing this kit on a system that includes Xterminals
        and you do NOT select DECwindows workstation support, then you will have
        to use the DECW$TAILOR utility to provide font files.

        DECwindows workstation support includes the 75 dots per inch video fonts.
    
        All DECwindows applications run with 75 dots per inch video fonts.
        By default, most systems startup with 75 dots per inch video fonts.
        Certain applications can take advantage of 100 dots per inch video fonts.
    
        For the VAXstation 4000 series machines, 100 dots per inch video fonts
        are used by default.  If you decide not to install 100 dots per inch
        video fonts, you must edit SYS$MANAGER:DECW$PRIVATE_SERVER_SETUP.COM
        to force 75 dots per inch video fonts to be the default.  Otherwise,
        certain applications may not space text properly.
    
        For instructions on how to configure your system with both 75 and 100
        dots per inch video fonts, see the installation guide or look at the
        template command procedure SYS$MANAGER:DECW$PRIVATE_SERVER_SETUP.TEMPLATE.
    
    * Do you want 100 dots per inch video fonts installed? (Y/N) y

        Beginning with OpenVMS V7.1, the DECnet-Plus kit is provided with
        the OpenVMS operating system kit.  Compaq strongly recommends that
        DECnet users install DECnet-Plus.  DECnet Phase IV applications are
        supported by DECnet-Plus.
    
        DECnet Phase IV is also provided as an option.  Support for DECnet
        Phase IV is available through a Prior Version Support Contract.
    
        If you install DECnet-Plus and TCP/IP you can run DECnet
        applications over a TCP/IP network.  Please see the OpenVMS
        Management Guide for information on running DECnet over TCI/IP.
    
        If you plan to install DECnet Phase IV do NOT select DECnet-Plus.
    
    * Do you want to install DECnet-Plus? (Y/N) y
    
        Space remaining on system disk:  2093591 blocks
    
        DECnet Phase IV will not be installed.

        In an OpenVMS Cluster, you can run multiple systems sharing all files
        except PAGEFILE.SYS, SWAPFILE.SYS, SYSDUMP.DMP, and VAXVMSSYS.PAR.
    
        Cluster configuration cannot be done at this time because no network
        is present.  In order to configure a cluster you must FIRST do one
        or both of the following:
    
            o Install DECnet-Plus (or DECnet Phase IV), or
            o Execute SYS$STARTUP:LAN$STARTUP.COM by removing the
              comment delimiter ("!") from the line
    
                    $! @SYS$STARTUP:LAN$STARTUP
    
              in SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM.
    
        Then configure the cluster by executing the following command:
    
                    @ @SYS$MANAGER:CLUSTER_CONFIG
    
        See the OpenVMS System Manager's Manual: Essentials for more information.

        Now we will ask you for new passwords for the following accounts:
    
            SYSTEM, SYSTEST, FIELD
    
        Passwords must be a minimum of 8 characters in length.  All passwords
        will be checked and verified.  Any passwords that can be guessed easily
        will not be accepted.
    

Enter a password, but make sure it has no `!` in them and is at least 8
characters long:

    
    
    * Enter password for SYSTEM:
    * Re-enter for verification:
    %UAF-I-MDFYMSG, user record(s) updated
    %VMS-I-PWD_OKAY, account password for SYSTEM verified

    * Re-enter for verification:
    %UAF-I-MDFYMSG, user record(s) updated
    %VMS-I-PWD_OKAY, account password for SYSTEST verified
    
    
        The SYSTEST_CLIG account will be disabled.  You must re-enable
        it before running UETP but do not assign a password.

Hostname:

    
    
    * Please enter the SCSNODE name: REMY1
    

Explanation taken from the article linked above:

For the SCSNODE name - the hostname, if you will - you'll have to remember to
use only 6 characters or less. The SCSSYSTEMID is a bit more complex. It's
calculated through the formula X * 1024 + Y, where X is the DECnet area number,
and Y the DECnet node number in that area.

Since we're starting from scratch, we can use X=1; for the node numbers, it
makes sense to think this through properly. Useful tip: use the last octet of
the IP address you want to assign to this machine! Since I want to give IPs
10.20.1.131 and 10.20.1.132 to the nodes, I'll give WHISKY Y=131, COGNAC Y=132.
This leaves us with a SCSSYSTEMID of 1155 for WHISKY, and DECnet code 1.131.
COGNAC will get 1156 as SCSSYSTEMID and DECnet code 1.132.

If you want machines to communicate with others over DECnet, you really, really
should communicate with those people on how to decide on DECnet addresses. If
you would want to join my cluster, you'll HAVE to use DECnet area 1, and you'll
HAVE to use a DECnet node number that's not 131 or 132.

Why? Because DECnet overwrites your MAC address, based on the DECnet address.
The 16-bit decimal address is converted to a hexadecimal number and appended to
the address AA:00:04:00 in byte-swapped order, with the least significant byte
first. For example, DECnet address 12.75 becomes 12363 (base 10), which equals
304B (base 16). After this byte-swapped address is appended to the standard
DECnet MAC address prefix, the resulting address is AA:00:04:00:4B:30 (thanks to
Cisco for that brief explanation). And, in the end, we really don't want to have
two identical MAC addresses on the same network, do we?

    
    
    * Please enter the SCSSYSTEMID:  1155
    
        After the installation finishes, you might want to do one or more of the
        following tasks:
    
        o DECOMPRESS THE SYSTEM LIBRARIES - To save space, many of the system
          libraries are shipped in a data-compressed format.  If you have
          enough disk space, you can decompress the libraries for faster access.
          To data expand the libraries, type:
    
            $ @SYS$UPDATE:LIBDECOMP.COM
    
          If you do not decompress these libraries, you will experience
          slower response to the HELP and LINK commands.
    
        o BUILD A STANDALONE BACKUP KIT - You can build a standalone backup kit
          using the procedure described in the "Backup Procedures" chapter of
          tye upgrade and installation supplement provided for your VAX computer.
    
        o TAILOR THE SYSTEM DISK - You might want to review the files provided or
          not provided during this installation.  If you find there are files
          you want to remove from the system disk (TAILOR OFF) or files you want
          to add (TAILOR ON), use the following utilities to perform the
          desired tailoring.
    
              OpenVMS tailoring:          $ RUN SYS$UPDATE:VMSTAILOR
    
              DECwindows tailoring:       $ RUN SYS$UPDATE:DECW$TAILOR
    
          NOTE:  The tailor procedure cannot be used to TAILOR ON or TAILOR OFF
                 files located on an alternate disk.

        Default Time Differential Factor is 1:00.
    
    
        The Time Differential Factor (TDF) is the difference between your
        system time and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  UTC is similar
        in most repects to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
    
        The TDF is expressed as hours and minutes, and should be entered
        in the hh:mm format.  TDFs for the Americas will be negative
        (-3:00, -4:00, etc.); TDFs for Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia
        will be positive (1:00, 2:00, etc.).
    
    
    Enter the Time Differential Factor [1:00]:
    
        NEW SYSTEM TIME DIFFERENTIAL FACTOR = 1:00.

        DECnet-Plus will now be installed.
    
        Media containing the DECnet-Plus kit must be available.
    
        If you are installing OpenVMS from an Infoserver (DAD1)
        or local CD-ROM, there is a DECnet-Plus kit on the CD-ROM.
    
        If you are installing from a cartridge tape (TK50) or
        from an open reel tape, you should have a DECnet-Plus kit
        on cartidge tape or open reel tape.
    
        An appropriate DECnet-Plus kit may also be available on
        the Consolidated Distribution CD-ROM, or you may have a
        separate DECnet-Plus kit.
    
        NOTE: You may choose any available media for the
        DECnet-Plus kit.  It is NOT NECESSARY to use the same
        type of media that contained the OpenVMS kit.
    
        If you do not have a DECnet-Plus kit available, or if you
        have decided NOT to install/upgrade DECnet-Plus, you can
        bypass the DECnet-Plus installation by entering "EXIT"
        for the "name of drive holding the DECnet-Plus kit".

### Add licenses

Now open up your PAK license key from the hobbyist program (the text file) and
paste it right in the shell. It will take a while. It will end with the
following:

    
    
     $ $!
     $ $! [End of File]
     $
    

To check if it worked:

    
    
     $ show license
    

Output:
