                <title>HP-UX 11.31 System information and find out part number of a failed disk with sasmgr</title>

                <description>On one of my regular scheduled datacenter visits one of the older HP-UX Itanium machines had an orange light on the front. These systems are not (yet) monitored, but still in use so the disk had to be replaced. Not knowing anything about this system or which parts were used, I managed to find the exact part number and device type so we could order a spare. This small guide uses sasmgr to get the data on HP-UX 11.31.</description>

                <title>Fix inconsistent Openstack volumes and instances from Cinder and Nova via the database</title>

                <description>When running Openstack, sometimes the state of a volume  or an instance can be inconsistent on the cluster. Nova might find a volume attached while Cinder says the volume is detached or otherwise. Sometimes a volume deletion hangs, or a detach does not work. If you've found and fixed the underlying issue (lvm, iscsi, ceph, nfs etc...) you need to bring the database up to date with the new consistent state. Most of the time a reset-state works, sometimes you need to manually edit the database to correct the state. These snippets show you how.</description>
