                <description>Recently a few of my Ubuntu 16.04 machines had issues and I was troubleshooting them, noticing `atop` logs missing. atop is a very handy tool which can be setup to record system state every X minutes, and we set it up to run every 5 minutes. You can then at a later moment see what the server was doing, even sorting by disk, memory, cpu or network usage. This post discusses the error and a quick fix.</description>
