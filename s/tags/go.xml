                <description>I'm an heavy user of RSS feeds, having over 1500 feeds I follow. Without a decent feed reader that setup wouldn't work. For over eight years now I've been an happy user of Tiny Tiny RSS, a web based feed reader. But, recently I found out about 'miniflux', also a web based RSS reader. In this article I'll compare the two for my use cases, mostly mobile usage. TD;DR, I've switched to Miniflux, due to it being more suited for mobile usage, less ajax heavy, easier to subscribe to feeds and a more pleasant reading layout.</description>
