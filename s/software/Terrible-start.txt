![Terrible Start][1]

The image you see above here is Terrible Start, a new piece of software I'm
creating for Terrible Linux, my debian respin. It will feature all the things in
the above screenshot and it is meant as a handy one click start for stuff you
want to do. Of course you will be able to turn it off at login, I do not want to
bother you with stuff you do not want to have.

_IT IS A BETA VERSION, NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION. IT MAY WORK, IT MAY NOT WORK,
IT ALSO CAN SPAWN A FEW MILLION CREAPERS AND PIG-RIDING SKELETONS WHO BLOW UP
AND KILL YOU MINECRAFT STYLE. IF THAT HAPPENS, PLEASE NUKE IT FROM ORBIT, IT IS
THE ONLY WAY TO BE SURE._

**I have a request for you all, I want to know what you want or do not want in a
start screen, features I can add or remove, thing you like or dislike et cetera.
I do not want to hear if you think a start screen is necessary, it will be
implemented and also be turned off easily. Please leave a comment below.**
