The AUR is a nice feature from Arch Linux, it allows anyone to create and upload
a simple package build script, PKGBUILD, for a piece of software which is not in
the repositories. Sometimes however, the PKGBUILD is outdated. You then need to
manually fix it, by changing the download link or version. With a new version
you get new checksums, and the `makepkg` command has a neat feature which
generates the checksums for you.

After you have updated your `PKGBUILD` you can get new checksums with the
following command:

    
    
    makepkg -g -f -p PKGBUILD
    

Where `PKGBUILD` is the actual PKGBUILD file with incorrect md5sums.

Output, for `newrelic-php5` in this example:

    
    
    ==> Retrieving sources...
      -> Found newrelic-php5-4.17.0.79-linux.tar.gz
      -> Found newrelic-daemon.service
      -> Found .install
    ==> Generating checksums for source files...
    md5sums=('c1c01fe1deed8e73508588a30e01046c'
             '4fc78347663adcb32ed28eddb546619c'
             'd3f7bb7fc0d84dff40d294384a32ddd3')
    

Update the `PKGBUILD` file with the new checksums and you are ready to try a new
build.
