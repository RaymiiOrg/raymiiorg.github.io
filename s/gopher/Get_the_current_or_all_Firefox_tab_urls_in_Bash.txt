This snippets gets the current firefox tab url or all the firefox tab url's. It
uses the sessionstore.js file in your profile folder. That file is updated
almost instantly, however it will not always be the correct url.

I use this to track my time on different websites over the day together with
some other shell scripts.

Get all the open tabs:

    
    
    python2 <<< $'import json\nf = open("/home/username/.mozilla/firefox/RANDOM.profile/sessionstore.js", "r")\njdata = json.loads(f.read())\nf.close()\nfor win in jdata.get("windows"):\n\tfor tab in win.get("tabs"):\n\t\ti = tab.get("index") - 1\n\t\tprint tab.get("entries")[i].get("url")'
    

Example output:

Get the current active/open tab number:

    
    
    python2 <<< $'import json\nf = open("/home/username/.mozilla/firefox/RANDOM.profile/sessionstore.js", "r")\njdata = json.loads(f.read())\nf.close()\nprint str(jdata["windows"][0]["selected"])'
    

Example output:

    
    
    11
    

Printing that line number from all open tab url's gives you the current open
tab. `sed -n "3p" file` prints line 3 from `file`. Combining the commands with
bash expansion results in the following:

    
    
    sed -n "$(python2 <<< $'import json\nf = open("/home/username/.mozilla/firefox/RANDOM.profile/sessionstore.js", "r")\njdata = json.loads(f.read())\nf.close()\nprint str(jdata["windows"][0]["selected"])')p" <(python2 <<< $'import json\nf = open("/home/username/.mozilla/firefox/RANDOM.profile/sessionstore.js", "r")\njdata = json.loads(f.read())\nf.close()\nfor win in jdata.get("windows"):\n\tfor tab in win.get("tabs"):\n\t\ti = tab.get("index") - 1\n\t\tprint tab.get("entries")[i].get("url")')
    

Output:

    
    
    http://tweakers.net/nieuws/list/20140902
    

This can also be in your `.bashrc` file:

    
    
    current_firefox_tab_number() {
        python2 <<< $'import json\nf = open("/home/username/.mozilla/firefox/RANDOM.profile/sessionstore.js", "r")\njdata = json.loads(f.read())\nf.close()\nprint str(jdata["windows"][0]["selected"])'
    }
    
    current_firefox_url() {
        sed -n "$(current_firefox_tab_number)p" <(python2 <<< $'import json\nf = open("/home/username/.mozilla/firefox/RANDOM.profile/sessionstore.js", "r")\njdata = json.loads(f.read())\nf.close()\nfor win in jdata.get("windows"):\n\tfor tab in win.get("tabs"):\n\t\ti = tab.get("index") - 1\n\t\tprint tab.get("entries")[i].get("url")')
    }
    

Example:

    
    
    $ current_firefox_tab_number 
    11
    
    $ current_firefox_url
