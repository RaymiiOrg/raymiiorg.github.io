This is a tutorial with a script which lets you set your IP address as
wallpaper.

You need to have a white background picture as base. Imagemagick will create it.

See an [example wallpaper here][2].

First install imagemagick & feh:

    
    
    apt-get install imagemagick feh
    

Then we'll make a bash script with the following in it:

    
    
    #!/bin/bash  
    export DISPLAY=:0.0  
    # Create white background image
    convert -size 1280x800 xc:white base.jpg
    
    # Create IP image
    convert base.jpg -pointsize 80 -fill lime -draw "text 0,150 'IPv4: $(ip -4 a s eth0 | grep -Eo 'inet [0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' | awk '{print $2}')'" -fill black -draw "text -0,250 'Hostname: $(uname -n)'" -pointsize 60 -draw "text -0,500 'Date $(date)'" ip.jpg 
    
    # Uncomment this one if you're not using gnome:  
    # feh --bg-scale ./3.jpg  
    # and place a # (hash) for the following rule:   
    gconftool -t string -s /desktop/gnome/background/picture_filename ./ip.jpg  
    

Save as ~/.back.sh and then **chmod 755 ~/.back.sh**

So, what this does is basically put the output of the ifconfig eth0 (change if
needed) command, and the time & date on the background image, then it sets the
background image to the newly created image.

And the _export DISPLAY=:0.0_ is because you can then run the script from of ssh
to.  
For that I also had a problem. Luckily I found the solution, but I forgot to
write down the source...

    
    
    ## as root, extract xauth info from user that started X  
    **$ XAUTHORITY=/home/username/.Xauthority xauth list**  
    hostname/unix:0 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 273bf22484148c6504f5d85e6ef510e5  
    hostname.sub.domain:0 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 273bf22484148c6504f5d85e6ef510e5
    
    # as current user, add xauth info to your xauth info...  
    **$ xauth add hostname/unix:0 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 273bf22484148c6504f5d85e6ef510e5  
    $ xauth add hostname.sub.domain:0 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 273bf22484148c6504f5d85e6ef510e5**  
    

Now you can set it as a crontab that runs every minute ( **crontab -e** ) or add
it to the gnome startup apps ( **gnome-session-properties** ).
