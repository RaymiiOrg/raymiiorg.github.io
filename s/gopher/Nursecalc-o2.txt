    Usage: ./o2.sh $si $pr $to $do 
    Three variables are needed, the other will be calculated. Unknown variable should be entered as 0
    $si = Size of the o2 tank in liters (eg 2, 5, 10)
    $pr = Pressure in o2 tank in atm (eg 120, 65, 90)
    $to = Total time o2 needs to run in minutes (eg 720, 300, 1500)
    $do = Dosage of o2 in ltr per minute (eg 2, 4, 10)
    example: ./o2.sh 2 85 2 0 will output 85 minutes.
    example: ./o2.sh 40 90 720 0 will output 5 liters per minute
