What is [Red Hat Certificate System:][2]

    
    
    Red Hat Certificate System provides a powerful security framework to manage user identities and ensure privacy of communications. Handling all the major functions of the identity life cycle, Red Hat Certificate System simplifies enterprise-wide deployment and adoption of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
    

[Dogtag][3] is the open source fork maintained by the Fedora project.

![The PKICONSOLE interface][4]

PKI Console is used as an administrative backend into the RHCS/Dogtag system. It
allows configuration of all kind of CA aspects, CRL's, Certificates, OCSP's and
much more. You login to the pkiconsole with an administrative user, most of the
time named admin. Dogtag/RHCS uses an LDAP database in the backend to store all
the information. In the case of dogtag 1.3 this is `fedora-ds`, all the latter
versions and RHCS use `389-ds`. The pkiconsole authenticates against this LDAP
database, so if you have the `Directory Manager` password you can reset the
`admin` password.

First locate the `/etc/pki-<instance-name>/password.conf` file. It looks like
this:

    
    
    hardware-pki-<instance-name>=0000
    internal=0000123400001234
    internaldb=00001234
    replicationdb=83729562
    

The `internaldb` value is the LDAP password for the `Directory Manager`. The
hardware part is used when you use a HSM.

Now we have the password for the `Directory Manager` we can login to the LDAP
and reset the admin password.

Use the following command to login to the LDAP of your CA instance, changing the
values for your setup:

    
    
    ldapmodify -H ldap://localhost:99389 -D "cn=Directory Manager" -Wx -e preread=userPassword
    

You will be asked for the Directory Manager password, after entering that you
don't see anything. You are now on an LDAP prompt, where you can enter `LDIF`
commands. The commands for changing the admin password are these:

    
    
    dn: uid=admin,ou=People,dc=pki-<instance-name>
    changetype:modify
    replace:userpassword
    userpassword: 1234
    

Press `return` twice after the last line. When successful it will show the
following:

    
    
    modifying entry "uid=admin,ou=People,dc=pki-<instance-name>"
    

Press `CTRL+C` twice afterwards, and you are done. You can now login to the
PKIConsole with your new password.
