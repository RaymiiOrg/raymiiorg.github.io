Today I wanted to upgrade a few packages on one of my FreeBSD servers. The vim
port kept complaining:

    
    
    [root@vps4 /usr/ports/editors/vim]# make reinstall clean
    ===> Options unchanged
    ====> You must select one and only one option from the UI single
    Config is invalid. Re-edit? [Y/n] Y
    ===> Options unchanged
    ====> You must select one and only one option from the UI single
    Config is invalid. Re-edit? [Y/n] n
    

It also did it with `make config` or `make clean`.

This is because the UI settings changed for vim, as `make showconfig` shows:

    
    
    [root@vps4 /usr/ports/editors/vim]# make showconfig
    ===> The following configuration options are available for vim-7.4.229_1:
         CSCOPE=off: cscope support
         EXUBERANT_CTAGS=off: Use exctags instead of ctags
         LUA=off: Lua scripting language support
         NLS=off: Native Language Support
         PERL=off: Perl scripting language support
         PYTHON=off: Python bindings or support
         RUBY=off: Ruby bindings or support
         TCL=off: Tcl scripting language support
         XTERM_SAVE=off: Restore xterm screen after exit
    ====> User interface: you have to select exactly one of them
         ATHENA=off: Athena GUI toolkit
         CONSOLE=off: Console/terminal mode
         GNOME=off: GNOME desktop environment support
         GTK2=off: GTK+ 2 GUI toolkit support
         MOTIF=off: Motif widget library support
         X11=off: X11 (graphics) support
    

Digging through the [FreeBSD Handbook][2], in section "5.5.1.1. Customizing
Ports Installation" we find the following little snippet:

> There are several ways to revisit a port's build options menu in order to add,
remove, or change these options after a port has been built. One method is to cd
into the directory containing the port and type make config. Another option is
to use make showconfig. Another option is to execute make rmconfig which will
remove all selected options and allow you to start over. All of these options,
and others, are explained in great detail in ports(7).

And as such, after `make rmconfig` and a new `make config-recursive` the upgrade
worked.
