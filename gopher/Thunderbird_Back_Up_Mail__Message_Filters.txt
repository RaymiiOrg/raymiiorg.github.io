This tutorial shows you how to backup and restore the mail message filters in
Thunderbird on multiple platforms. The filters are in a plain text file located
in your thunderbird Profile folder. On Mac OS X for example this is under the
`/Users/<username>/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/<profile>/ImapMail/<mailserver>/`
folder. (If you use IMAP.)

The file is named `msgFilterRules.dat` and the contents look a bit like this:

    
    
    version="9"
    logging="no"
    name="From is: dan@sixgun.org"
    enabled="yes"
    type="17"
    action="Move to folder"
    actionValue="imap://user%40host.com@imap.server.com/Folder"
    condition="AND (from,is,dan@sixgun.org)"
    

The above example moves any email coming from the email address `dan@sixgun.org`
to the folder `Folder` on the IMAp account.

To back up all the filters, do the following:

  * Close all instances of Thunderbird
  * Copy the file `msgFilterRules.dat` to a backup location.

To restore the file, to the following:

  * Close all instances of Thunderbird
  * Copy the file `msgFilterRules.dat` back into your (possibly new) profile folder

Under any normal Linux distro the path probably is like this:

    
    
    /home/<username>/.thunderbird/Profiles/<profile>/ImapMail/<mailserver>/msgFilterRules.dat
    

For Mac OS X the path is like this:

    
    
    /Users/<username>/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/<profile>/ImapMail/<mailserver>/msgFilterRules.dat
    

For Windows the path probably is like this on pre Vista machines:

    
    
    C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data\Thunderbird\Profiles\<profile>\ImapMail\<mailserver>\msgFilterRules.dat
    

The latter versions of Windows (vista, 7, 8):

    
    
    C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\<profile>\ImapMail\<mailserver>\msgFilterRules.dat
    

If you want to convert these Thunderbird rules to `.procmailrc` rules a script
for that can be found [here:
