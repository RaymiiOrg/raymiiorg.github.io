> Screenshot of Markdown being rendered by Qt


I recently discovered that Qt QML can render Markdown in `Text{}` controls. 
This snippet shows you how to do that including a screenshot and demo QML app.

Qt 5.14 [added support][1] for markdown in `Text` and `TextEdit` controls:

- Added support for the Markdown format (including CommonMark and GitHub
  dialects) to Text and TextEdit as an alternative to HTML. This includes the
  GitHub checklist extension, allowing to toggle checkboxes in a TextEdit.

The `textFormat` property was already able to render basic HTML but since 5.14 you can
specify `textFormat: TextEdit.Markdowntext` to render markdown:

    TextEdit.MarkdownText: CommonMark plus the GitHub extensions for tables
    and task lists (since 5.14)

I heavily use markdown so this is a joy for me to use compared to HTML for
simple formatting.

Here is a full QML example of both a `Text` and a `TextEdit`. Note that the `TextEdit` does not parse markdown
as you write, it just formats the text you have set as markdown.

    import QtQuick 2.15
    import QtQuick.Window 2.15

        QtObject{
            id: markdown
            // not having tabs or spaces is important, otherwise
            // the markdown will not render.
            property string text: "*Italic*    **Bold**
