Inspired by recent articles from [Kev Quirk][3], [Horst Gutmann][4] and [Jan-Lukas][5]
where they do a cost breakdown of their sites, I decided to do one as well. Kev 
is around USD 30, Horst is around USD 13 and Jan-Lukas is around 5 USD. Their 
breakdowns are interesting, from specific wordpress plugins to CDN or DNS costs. 
I don't have those, but I do have a multitude of small servers running this site,
which add up to around USD 20, adding up two domain names gives me around USD 22
per month. It could be a lot cheaper, I only need one server for the gigantuous 
amounts of static HTML this site consists of, but I do have around [10.000][7] unique
visitors each day, so having redundancy is nice. If I would go all cheap, this 
site would cost me no more than 2 USD a month including the domain name, but 
that would take the fun out of it.

This site is generated with my self-written open source static site generator
named [ingsoc][2] (named after 1984). The hosting therefore consists of just
[simple VPS servers][6], running some form of Linux or BSD that I can manage
with Ansible. The [VPS servers][99] don't need many resources, 2 GB of disk and 
128 MB of RAM is enough, all of the current servers have better specs because
nobody sells low end VPSes anymore. After the first sale of LowEndBox.org the 
fun was gone there, I used to be very active on the site and forum there.

I sometimes write updates on new changes in ingsoc, those articles can be found [here][1]. 

Here is a list of `How much does my site cost me` articles I found and enjoyed:

- [Kev Quirk][3]
- [Guillermo Garron][9]
- [Horst Gutmann][4]
- [Jan-Lukas][5]
- [Hyde][10] (dedicated server, wow)
- [Roland Szabo][11]
- [Gregory Hammond][12]
- [Alex Lueken][13]

### Cost breakdown

This site uses multiple servers spread around the world. The up to date list
[can be found on the Cluster Status page][6] and as of now also has the monthly
cost of the servers. 

<table>
    <tr><td><b>Service</b></td><td><b>Montly Cost</b></td></tr>
    <tr><td>VPS (6)</td><td>USD 20 (EUR 8.70 + USD 9.30, conversion rate varies)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Domain (2)</td><td>EUR 2</td></tr>
</table>

I use two domain names, one for the site (`raymii.org`) and one for the servers
(`spnw.nl`, stands for Sparkling Network). Both domain names cost me EUR 12.50 a
year. The servers vary, I like to play with other providers, but I keep it less
than 20 USD per month. 

There are no other costs, no seperate DNS hosting, no CDN, no wordpress plugins,
none. This site does use [github][8] as a middleman for the servers to do their
hourly checkout, but that is optional. Whenever I do an update, my scripts place
the content as well. The fallback via github is for either the initial checkout
or when a server has been offline for a while.
