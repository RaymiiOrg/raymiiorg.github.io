Bash Bits are small examples and tips for Bash Scripts. This bash bit shows you
how to randomize the time a cronjob runs in /etc/cron.d/

### Randomize cronjob time

I've used this in the past in a [backup script][3] I wrote. During the
installation, a cronjob was placed and later the time was randomized between
00:00 AM and 06:00 AM. This way the load on the backup targets wouldn't be a
huge peak but more spread out.

First, place your cronjob in `/etc/cron.d/`, as a file. In this case,
`/etc/cron.d/my_example`. Use the regular `cron.d` format (include the username
between the time and executable):

    
    
    #!/bin/bash
    RANDM RANDH * * * root /usr/local/bin/my_binary
    

Note the two variables, `RANDM` and `RANDH`. These will be replaced to the
random hour and minute.

The following code will replace the variables with random digits, but in the
range you specify:

    
    
    # use awk to get a number between 0 and 6 for the hour
    RANDH="$(awk 'BEGIN{srand();print int(rand()*(0-6))+6 }')"
    # and 0 to 59 for the minutes. 
    RANDM="$(awk 'BEGIN{srand();print int(rand()*(0-59))+59 }')"
    # Replace it in the cronjob.
    sed -i -e "s/RANDH/${RANDH}/g" -e "s/RANDM/${RANDM}/g" /etc/cron.d/my_example
    # show the user
    echo "Randomized cronjob time, will run on ${RANDH}:${RANDM}."
    

You could use the bash builtin `$RANDOM`, but then you cannot specify a range.
You could get an illigal time that way.
