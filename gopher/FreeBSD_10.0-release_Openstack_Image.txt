We are going to prepare a FreeBSD image for Openstack deployment. We do this by
creating a FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE instance, installing it and converting it using
[bsd-cloudinit][1]. We'll use the [CloudVPS][2] public Openstack cloud for this.
Create an account there and install the Openstack command line tools, like
`nova`, `cinder` and `glance`. This tutorial is more a collection of notes than
what you are used of me, it has less explanation and such, just right on steps
to get started.

You can see all my [Openstack related articles here][3]. For example, how to use
[Duplicity to create Encrypted backups to the Openstack Swift Object Store][4]

This tutorial is available for:

  * [FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE.][6]
  * [FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE.][7]
  * [FreeBSD 10.3-RELEASE.][8]
  * [FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE.][9]

Set the correct environment variables:

    
    
    export OS_AUTH_URL="https://identity.stack.cloudvps.com/v2.0"
    export OS_TENANT_NAME="<tenant name>"
    export OS_USERNAME="<username>"
    export OS_PASSWORD="<password>"
    export OS_TENANT_ID="<tenant id>"
    

Start by downloading the 10.0-RELEASE iso:

    
    
    wget http://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/amd64/amd64/ISO-IMAGES/10.0/FreeBSD-10.0-RELEASE-amd64-disc1.iso
    

Upload it to Openstack:

    
    
    glance image-create --file Downloads/FreeBSD-10.0-RELEASE-amd64-disc1.iso --name "FreeBSD-10.0-RELEASE-amd64-disc1.iso" --disk-format iso --container-format bare --progress
    

Create the root volume for our FreeBSD preparation install:

    
    
    cinder create --display-name "freebsd-10-root" 8
    

Boot a new instance from the ISO, attaching the volume we just created ad well:

    
    
    nova boot --image <freebsd iso image id> --flavor "Standard 1" --availability-zone NL1 --nic net-id=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --block-device-mapping hdb=<volume freebsd-10-root id>:::0 FreeBSD-10.0-RELEASE-install
    

Do a standard install of FreeBSD 10:

  * default keymap
  * hostname: freebsd.public.cloudvps.com
  * Just lib32 and ports, no doc, games or src
  * Partition Layout: 
    * ada0 GPT
    * ada0p1 64kb freebsd-boot
    * ada0p2 512MB freebsd-swap
    * ada0p3 7GB freebsd-root mountpoint /
  * Root password P@ssw0rd
  * Network: 
    * adapter: vtnet0
    * ipv4: dhcp
    * ipv6: slaac
    * search: public.cloudvps.com
  * UTC: no, timezone 8 EUROPE 34 NETHERLANDS
  * Services at boot: sshd, ntpd, moused, dumpd
  * Extra user: 
    * Username: freebsd
    * Full name: freebsd
    * uid: default
    * Login group: default
    * Other groups: wheel
    * Login class: default
    * Shell: tcsh
    * Home: default
    * Home permissions: default
    * Password auth: yes
    * Empty password: no
    * Random password: no
    * Password: P@ssw0rd
    * Lock out: no
    * OK: yes
    * Another user: no
  * Exit

After install, edit `/etc/fstab`, changing `ada0` to `vtbd0`. This is for VirtIO
support.

Shut the instance from FreeBSD using `shutdown -p now` and after that via nova:

    
    
    nova stop <install vm id>
    

Detach the volume:

    
    
    nova volume-detach <install vm id> <install root volume id>
    

Boot a new instance with the installed freebsd volume as the root volume:

    
    
    nova boot --block-device source=volume,id=<root volume id>,dest=volume,shutdown=preserve,bootindex=0 --flavor "Standard 1" --availability-zone NL1 --nic net-id=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000  FreeBSD-10.0-RELEASE-configure
    

If you get a mountroot error, enter the following: ufs:/dev/vtbd0p3.

Change `/etc/fstab` after the fact, change `ada0` to `vtbd0` for VirtIO support.

Set the default route:

    
    
    route add default `ifconfig vtnet0 | grep "inet " | cut -d" " -f 2 | awk -F. '{print $1"."$2"."$3".1" }'`
    

Also put it in `/etc/rc.local` to make sure it works on bootup.

Bootstrap pkg:

    
    
    pkg
    

Enter y.

Install vim and py27-setuptools (for bsd-cloudinit):

    
    
    pkg install vim-lite py27-setuptools
    

Add your SSH key:

    
    
    mkdir /root/.ssh
    chmod 700 /root/.ssh
    echo "ssh-rsa AAAA[...] user@example.com" > /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
    

Install python modules for bsd-cloudinit:

    
    
    rehash
    easy_install eventlet
    easy_install iso8601
    

Add the following to `/boot/loader.conf` to make sure the console works:

    
    
    console="comconsole,vidconsole"
    autoboot_delay="5"
    

Now do any other customizations you want to have in your image.

Do the bsd-cloudinit install:

    
    
    fetch --no-verify-peer https://raw.github.com/pellaeon/bsd-cloudinit-installer/master/installer.sh
    chmod +x installer.sh
    ./installer.sh
    set history = 0
    history -c
    

Turn the machine off:

    
    
    shutdown -p now
    

Terminate the machine, otherwise you cannot detach the volume (ERROR: Can't
detach root device volume (HTTP 403)):

    
    
    nova delete <id of freebsd-configure vm)
    

Convert the volume to an image:

    
    
    cinder upload-to-image <freebsd-10-root volume id> FreeBSD-10.0-RELEASE-cloudinit
    

This might take a while.

Set the min-disk and min-ram requirements, plus some more properties for the
image:

    
    
    glance image-update --min-disk 8 --min-ram 1024 --property architecture=x86_64 --property image_supports_keypair=true --property image_supports_password=true --property supported=false <id from the converted volume image>
    

If needed, make it public:

    
    
    glance --name "UNSUPPORTED: FreeBSD-10.0-RELEASE" --is-public True <id from the converted volume image>
    

That's it. You are done and have a good workable freebsd image.

Boot a new instance from your newly created image:

    
    
    nova boot --image <id from the converted volume image> --flavor "Standard 4" --availability-zone NL1 --nic net-id=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 --key-name <your ssh key> FreeBSD-10.0-RELEASE-cloudinit
    

When the instance has spawned you can login as the freebsd user,
freebsd@ipaddress.
