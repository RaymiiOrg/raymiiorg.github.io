Dropbear is a lightweight SSH server and client implementation, often used on
embedded systems and routers. If you use the [dropbear SSH client (dbclient)][1]
and want to use a private key, it needs to be in the dropbear format and cannot
have a passphrase. Dropbear provides a conversion utility to convert openssh
style keys to dropbear style keys, dropbearconvert, but on Ubuntu it's not in
your $PATH. This means you have to provide the full path to execute it, which is
cumbersome. There is a [bug in Ubuntu][2] that has been reported in 2012, but in
Ubuntu 18.04 (2019) it's still not fixed.

This is the full path to dropbearconvert:

    
    
    /usr/lib/dropbear/dropbearconvert
    

This is an example to convert an OpenSSH style private key to a dropbear style
private key:

    
    
    usr/lib/dropbear/dropbearconvert openssh dropbear ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa_dropbear
    

Your dropear style private key will be located in `~/.ssh/id_rsa
~/.ssh/id_rsa_dropbear`.

Do note that your private key cannot be protected with a passphrase. Dropbear
does not support this.
