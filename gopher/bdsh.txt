bdsh is a shell where you whitelist commands and only those commands can be
executed. Either via ssh, as an interactive shell or launched with commands.
Logs everything and escapes "dangerous" characters.

bdsh stands for Boa Diminish SHell. You can probably guess why. It might have to
to with snakes and restricting users, no pun intended.

### What is the reason you wrote bdsh?

Sometimes sysadmins are forced to work with insecure systems or badly written
applications. Critical systems working with a push model instead of a pull
model, things that use ssh and break when stuff changes or users that need to be
audit trailed.

I couldn't find an easy way to set a shell for a user that both logs and is
configurable via a whitelist. I tried scripts in `authorized_keys` but then
things `scp` and `sftp` break. bdsh tries to solve that and is fairly successful
in that.

### Requirements

  * Python 2.6+ 
    * Python 3 is supported!

bdsh is tested on Ubuntu, CentOS, OpenSUSE and Debian all with Python 2.7 or
above.

### Download

Either from github:

    
    
    git clone https://github.com/RaymiiOrg/boa-diminish-restricted-shell.git
    

Or from this website:

    
    
    wget http://raymii.org/s/inc/software/bdsh.py
    

### Installation

  * Clone the git repo &&&& cd in
  * Install bdsh sytemwide 
    * `sudo cp bdsh.py /usr/bin/bdsh`
    * `sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/bdsh`
  * Edit and place whitelist 
    * `vi example_whitelist.conf &&&& sudo cp example_whitelist.conf /etc/bdsh_whitelist.conf`
  * Edit `/etc/shells` and add `/usr/bin/bdsh`
  * Set the shell for the user, either via: 
    * `sudo chsh -s /usr/bin/bdsh $USERNAME`
    * or
    * `vi /etc/passwd`

### Tips

#### Enable SFTP/SCP

Put these two lines in the whitelist file:

    
    
    scp
    /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
    

Note that you might have to change `scp` to `/usr/bin/scp`.

### Important

bdsh only checks if the command is whitelisted, not the arguments. So if you
allow `ls`, you also allow `ls -la`, and `ls -d` and such.

bdsh is not 100% safe, but it does provide a layer of security.

Read this article about restriced shells: http://pen-
testing.sans.org/blog/2012/06/06/escaping-restricted-linux-shells

Don't change the "Dangerous Characters" array, if you for example remove the
`&&` then you can do something like this: `ssh user@host "ls &&&& perl -e 'exec
"/bin/bash"'"`.

It does try its best to catch restriction-escaping:

    
    
    Jun 29 17:41:07 localhost bdsh: [RESTRICTED SHELL]: user "testshell" executed vim
    Jun 29 17:41:11 localhost bdsh: [RESTRICTED SHELL]: user "testshell" NOT allowed for /usr/bin/bdsh -c bash
