The OpenStack dashboard, Horizon, is a great piece of software to manage your
OpenStack resources via the web. However, it has, in my opinion, a very big
usability issue. The loading dialog that appears after you click a link. It
blocks the entire page and all other links. So, whenever I click, I have to wait
three to five seconds before I can do anything else. Clicked the wrong menu
item? Sucks to be you, here have some loading. Clicked a link and quickly want
to open something in a new tab while the page is still loading? Nope, not today.
It's not that browsers have had a function to show that a page is loading, no,
of course, the loading indication that has been there forever is not good
enough. Let's re-invent the wheel and significantly impact the user experience.
With two rules in uBlock Origin this loading modal is removed and you can work
normally again in Horizon

Here's a screenshot of the loading dialog:

To remove the dialog, install uBlock Origin and open up the preferences. Go to
the My List tab, and add the following rules:

    
    
    your.horizon-url.net##.loading
    your.horizon-url.net##.modal-backdrop
    

Put your own domain URL there. If you just want to have the loading dialog, but
not the backdrop that blocks everything, leave out the last line.

Afterwards, reload the dashboard and enjoy your enhanched user experience.
