Love plaintext? This script downloads an URL, parses it with readability and
returns the plaintext (as markdown). It supports RSS feeds (will convert every
article in the feed) and saves every article.

My usecase is twofold. One is to convert RSS feeds to a [Gopher site][1], the
second is to get full text in my RSS reader.

The script contains a few workarounds for so-called cookiewalls. It also pauses
between RSS feed articles to not do excessive requests.

The readability part is handled by Python, no external services are used.

[Github repo with source code][4]

## Installation

First install the required libraries.

On Ubuntu:

    
    
    apt-get install python python-pip #python2
    pip install html2text requests readability-lxml feedparser
    

Other distro's, use the `pip` command above.

Clone the repository:

    
    
    git clone https://github.com/RaymiiOrg/to-text.py
    

## Usage

    
    
    usage: totext.py [-h] -u URL [-s SLEEP] [-r] [-n]
    
    Convert HTML page to text using readability and html2text.
    
    arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -u URL, --url URL     URL to convert (Required)
      -s SLEEP, --sleep SLEEP
                            Sleep X seconds between URLs (only in rss)
      -r, --rss             URL is RSS feed. Parse every item in feed
      -n, --noprint         Dont print converted contents
    

If you want to run the script via a cronjob, use the `-n` option to not have
output.

If the parsing failed, the article will contain the text: `parsing failed`.

## Examples

    
    
    python totext.py --rss --url https://raymii.org/s/feed.xml
    python totext.py --url https://www.rd.nl/vandaag/binnenland/grootste-stijging-verkeersdoden-in-jaren-1.1562067
    

## Saved text

Every file converted will also be saved to the folder `saved/$hostname`. The
filenames are sorted by date.
