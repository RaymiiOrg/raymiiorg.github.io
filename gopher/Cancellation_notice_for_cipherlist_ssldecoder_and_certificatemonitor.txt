### Cancellation

This is a short notice that the public services I was providing, 
[cipherli.st][1], [txtn.ws][5], [ssldecoder.org][2] and
[certificatemonitor.org][3] are suspended and cancelled as of now. The source
code is still available via [my github][4], but the domains and hosting are
stopped. If you want to use these services, you now must host them yourself.


Any information on these websites, tests or services provides by those websites
is now no longer from me, related to me or endorsed by me. The domains have
been cancelled and will be available for registration again when the cool
down period expires.


A friend and fellow [revspace][6] member Mark Janssen has also hosted these services. 
[Read his post here][7], where he states that he has forked the repositories, links
to the source code and has used the same license for the forks.

If you want to use the software I made, please use Mark's versions here:

- [https://ssldecoder.eu](https://ssldecoder.eu) -- Print information about site-certificates or CSR's
- [https://sslmonitor.eu](https://sslmonitor.eu) -- Get mail notifications about expiring certificates
- [https://cipherlist.eu](https://cipherlist.eu) -- Recommended TLS/SSL configurations for populair services
