While doing my monitoring script [ray-mon][1] I found out it can be quite hard
to get the correct values for uptime, load average and users on different
systems.

For example, the _uptime_ command displays this on a mac:

    
    
     8:27  up 1 day, 17:06, 1 user, load averages: 1,01 0,87 0,79
    

This on a debian 6 machine:

    
    
     06:27:33 up 4 days,  2:36,  2 users,  load average: 0.16, 0.26, 0.27
    

This on a RHEL 5 machine:

    
    
     06:28:26 up 54 min,  127 users,  load average: 6.34, 6.28, 6.27    
    

Small differences in space placement, "load averages:" instead of "load
average:" and "min" vs "days". It took me quite a while to find out how to get
the correct values for the following items using just unix tools:

  * Uptime
  * Amount of users logged in
  * Current load average

#### Uptime

    
    
    uptime | grep -ohe 'up .*' | sed 's/,//g' | awk '{ print $2" "$3 }'
    

First take the output of uptime to grep, only show matching characters (-oh) and
do regex (-e). Filter on "up" "space" "everything after that". Then go to sed to
remove the comma's "4 days," to "4 days", and then with awk print the second and
third collumn, and remove the rest of the output.

#### Users logged in

    
    
    uptime | grep -ohe '[0-9.*] user[s,]'
    

Take the output of uptime to grep, only show matching characters (-oh), and do
regex (-e). Filter on "number between 0 and 9" "any amount of the previous
character" "space" "user, or users"

#### Load

    
    
    uptime | grep -ohe 'load average[s:][: ].*' | awk '{ print $3 }'
    

First take the output of uptime to grep. only show matching characters (-oh),
and do regex (-e). Filter on "load average: or load averages:" "everything after
that". The with awk print the 3d collumn.
