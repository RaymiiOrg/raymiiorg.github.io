This little snippets helps you change all the computer names of a computer
running Mac OS X. OS X has 3 computernames, and if you want to change all three
you need to use the following commands (as root or via sudo):

    
    
    scutil --set ComputerName "ChangeMe"
    scutil --set HostName "ChangeMe"
    scutil --set LocalHostName "ChangeMe"
    

Where you change "ChangeMe" to the computer name you want to set.

**ComputerName** is the so-called "user-friendly" name for the Mac, it's what
will show up on the Mac itself and what will be visible to others when
connecting to it over a local network. This is also whats visible under the
Sharing preference panel.

**HostName** is the name assigned to the computer as visible from the command
line, and it's also used by local and remote networks when connecting through
SSH and Remote Login.

**LocalHostName** is the name identifier used by Bonjour and visible through
file sharing services like AirDrop
