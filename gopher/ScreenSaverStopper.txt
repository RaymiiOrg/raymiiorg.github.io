### Screensaver Stopper

ScreensaverStopper sends the F24 keystroke every 40 seconds. This way, Windows 
should not activate the screensaver. Useful if you do not have rights to 
disable the screensaver, but can run executables.

I've written it to solve a personal annoyance. At work I have a Windows 10
virtual machine (for Visual  Studio, network file share access and the Microsoft
Office Suite). I cannot  disable the screensaver, due to GPO policy. I can
however, compile and run software.

There is no window, no output, no settings, just a keystroke every 40 seconds. 
If you need to stop the application, use the task manager.
