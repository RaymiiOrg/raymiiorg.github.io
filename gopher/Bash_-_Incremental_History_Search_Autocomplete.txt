This little snippet for your .bashrc or your .inputrc changes the Up/Down arrow
behavior to autocomplete what is already typed instead of just go back in
history.

Normally when you press Up in Bash you get the previous command. With these
lines that is changed. If you typed `vim filename`, then `top` and then again
`vim` and pres up, it will autocomplete to `vim filename` instead of go back to
`top`.

Either in your `.bashrc`:

    
    
    bind '"\e[A": history-search-backward'
    bind '"\e[B": history-search-forward'
    

Or in your `.inputrc`:

    
    
    "\e[A": history-search-backward
    "\e[B": history-search-forward
