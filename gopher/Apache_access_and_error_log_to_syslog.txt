Using the double pipe prevents spawning a shell for every hit. Append the below
line to a vhost to have everything logged to syslog.

    
    
    CustomLog "||/usr/bin/logger -t apache -i -p local5.notice" combine
    

The error log can be appended to syslog using the following statement:

    
    
     ErrorLog syslog:local6
