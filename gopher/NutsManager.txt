NutsManager is a power/gas/water usage tracker written in PHP. It uses a JSON
text file for the values and the visual side is created with the excellent HTML5
Kickstart framework by Joshua Gatcke. The graphs are made with the flot
framework.

It helps me to keep track of my power usage, and shows me on which days I use a
lot, and on which days I do not. That way, I know that a LAN party costs me a
lot.
