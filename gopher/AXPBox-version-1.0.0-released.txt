> OpenVMS in AXPbox with an X session, (run sys$system:decw$startlogin.exe)

Last year November, I [posted][6] on a new OpenVMS related project, [AXPbox, the open source
Alpha emulator][0], a fork of es40 by Tom&aacute;&scaron; Glozar. 

I got involved a bit in the project, submitting a few patches here and there, editing
the Wiki and thus now have contributer rights on the github repository. After discussing
a bit back and forth with Tom&aacute;&scaron;, I put together the first official release
of AXPbox, very exciting news. 

The release [can be found here][8] on github. This article has the release notes
and a bunch of screenshots of OpenVMS inside AXPbox running GUI applications
over the network.

You can find my [installation guide for OpenVMS with networking here][7].

### Release notes v1.0.0

The release notes are copied here below.

The first official release of AXPbox, the open source Alpha emulator forked
from es40, automatically compiled via Github Actions for a variety of
different platforms and incorporating a few fixes and improvements. Most fixes
are related to the build system, there are a few stability improvements and
some code is modernized.

This release runs HP OpenVMS 8.3, VSI OpenVMS 8.4 and VSI OpenVMS 8.42L1,
NetBSD 8.2 and NetBSD 6.1.2 without major issues. See
[here](https://github.com/lenticularis39/axpbox/wiki/Guest-support) for more
information and other operating systems.

Installation instructions and more guides can be found on [the wiki](https://github.com/lenticularis39/axpbox/wiki)

#### What doesn't work (also see issues)

- Some guest operating systems (see Guest support)
- ARC
- VGA in OpenVMS
- SDL keyboard (partly works, but easily breaks)
- Multiple CPU system emulation
- Running on big endian platforms
- Some SCSI and IDE commands
- Networking for a longer time (breaks after a couple minutes)
- Copying large files between IDE CD-ROM to IDE hard drive (this usually doesn't affect OpenVMS installation)

The linux ARM build is compiled statically, without networking, graphics or
SDL support due to cross-compilation. It is recommended to compile it yourself
on your own ARM hardware.

### Screenshots

Here are some more screenshots of this release, mostly of my experiments with
a remote X session.

First start up a remote X server on your local workstation:

    Xephyr -screen 1024x768 -ac -query 10.0.2.25 :1

Replace `10.0.2.25` by the IP of your OpenVMS server (AXPbox).

Start an X session inside OpenVMS:

    set display/create/node=10.0.2.15/transport=tcpip/server=1

Replace `10.0.2.15` by the IP of your workstation where the remote X server
runs.

> After logging in, this screen pops up

I wasn't able to get any further into a CDE session than this, but [here][10], Dieter 
shows a screenshot of a full CDE session inside AXPbox:

OpenVMS Commands to start:

    $ show log cde$sessionmain
       "CDE$SESSIONMAIN" = "mcr cde$system_defaults:[bin]dtsession" (LNM$SYSTEM_TABLE)

    $ mcr cde$system_defaults:[bin]dtsession
