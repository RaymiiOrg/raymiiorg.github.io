This is a bash script for Ubuntu and Debian, to be run by cron on a set
interval. It checks if there are apt-updates, and if so, mails an overview of
the packages which can be updated, whith their local version, the version
available and an URL to the Ubuntu package site where you can see the changelog.
I wrote this as an addition for my Nagios monitoring, that only shows how many
updates there are, this is a lot more verbose. It also runs on Debian since 1
Nov 2012. Only the links don't work then, because the packages are different.
