This small snippet gets all the SSH keys from a gitlab instance.
You need to be an administrator, then you can query all keys at once using
the API. On the web frontend you can only see the keys per user, not all at
once in an overview.

I'm using `jq` to filter out specific fields of the JSON API output, but you can
omit that and just use shell (`awk`/`sed`) if you want to.

### SSH keys via the API

In [the API] you can query keys by ID. As far as I could find, there is no way to
find out how many keys there are, so you have to gamble that a bit, in my case 
500 was enough since the gitlab instace I used only has 400-ish users.

You also need a personal access token for your administrative account, which 
you can create via your gitlab profile, under `Settings` and then `Access Tokens`.

This is the full command:

	for i in $(seq 1 500); do 
	  curl --silent --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $your_token_here" "https://your_gitlab_URL.com/api/v4/keys/$i" | \
	  jq -M -c -r '[.key, .user.name]'  | \
	  grep -v null ;  
	done

Replace the token and domain name by your domain name.

Example output:

	["ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1y[...]zmSDQ== key1","User Name"]
	["ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1y[...]GaE6cC1 key2","User Name"]
	["ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3N[...]9W key5", "Other User Name"]

You can use the `|@sh` or `|@tsv` output modifier to get rid of the quotes and 
square brackets:

	for i in $(seq 1 500); do 
	  curl --silent --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: $your_token_here" "https://your_gitlab_URL.com/api/v4/keys/$i" | \
	  jq -M -c -r '[.key, .user.name]|@tsv'  | \
	  grep -v null ;  
	done


Output: 

	ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3N[...]9W  key5 Other User Name
