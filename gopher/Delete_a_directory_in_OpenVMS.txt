My OpenVMS adventure continues, in this small item I talk about the removal of
folders on OpenVMS. As you might expect, different than on linux.

I tried to set up SSH public key authentication so that I can use my regular SSH
key instead of typing my password on the DECUServe system. I found [a guide][3]
for that in the HPe documentation. That however required the creation of some
files and folders and I made a typo in the creation of a folder. Of course I
noticed that way too late so there were files in there as well.

As you might have guessed, I went down a different rabbit hole to remove this
folder, SSH public key authentication does not work yet. The [DECUServe][4]
system allows SSH login with a password initially.

### DIR [.SSH]

The folder I created is named `SSH`, but it should be named `SSH2`. This is
what's in the folder:

    
    
     $ dir [.SSH]
    
    Directory EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE.SSH]
    
    AUTHORIZATION.;3    REMY-GATEWAY.PUB;1
    
    Total of 2 files.
    

OpenVMS seperates folders with the period (`.`) and they must be enclosed in
square brackets. The first period expands to the current folder.

After creating the correct folder (`CREATE /DIRECTORY [.SSH2]`) and copying the
files over:

    
    
     $ copy [.SSH]*.*;* [.SSH2]
     $ 
    

It was time to remove the folder.

### rm -rf [.SSH]?

Let's try to apply some logic here. `CREATE` is the command to create files and
folders. So would `REMOVE` then remove a folder?

    
    
     $ REMOVE [.SSH]
    %DCL-W-IVVERB, unrecognized command verb - check validity and spelling
     \REMOVE\
    

Nope, it doesn't. Let's try what we know from *NIX:

    
    
     $ RM
    _Remote host:
     Interrupt
    

No clue what that does, but it's not removing my folder. ^C gets me out.

But, OpenVMS has a very extensive `HELP` system, lets find out what `RM` does:

    
    
    RMS
    
         OpenVMS Record Management Services (RMS) are generalized routines
         that assist user programs in processing and managing files and
         records. 
         [...]
    

Okay, nice, but not what I was looking for. `RMDIR` maybe?

    
    
     $ RMDIR [.SSH]
    %DCL-W-IVVERB, unrecognized command verb - check validity and spelling
     \RMDIR\
    

Last resort, the Windows BATCH DEL command:

    
    
     $ del
    _File:
    Interrupt
    

That at least asks for a filename. Let's see if we can get the directory syntax
right:

This all failed, syntax wise not the correct format to specify a folder:

    
    
    $ DEL [.SSH]
    %DELETE-E-DELVER, explicit version number or wild card required
    

A version number you say? This excellent filesystem has versioning built in.

    
    
     $ DEL [.SSH];1
    %DELETE-W-SEARCHFAIL, error searching for EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE.SSH].;1
    -RMS-E-FNF, file not found
    

The version number inside the brackets?

    
    
     $ DEL [.SSH;1]
    %DCL-W-DIRECT, invalid directory syntax - check brackets and other delimiters
    

The `DIR` command shows me that the folder is named `[.SSH.DIR]`. Lets try that:

    
    
     $ del [.SSH.DIR];1
     %DELETE-W-SEARCHFAIL, error searching for EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE.SSH.DIR].;1
     -RMS-E-DNF, directory not found
     -SYSTEM-W-NOSUCHFILE, no such file
    

At this point in time I thought that maybe I had to remove all the files first
inside the folder. One by one I tried:

    
    
     $ DIR [.SSH]
    
    Directory EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE.SSH]
    
    AUTHORIZATION.;3    REMY-GATEWAY.PUB;1
    
    Total of 2 files.
    
    
     $ DEL [.SSH]AUTHORIZATION.;3
     $ DEL [.SSH]REMY-GATEWAY.PUB;1
     $
    

Folder is empty now:

    
    
     $ DIR [.SSH]
    %DIRECT-W-NOFILES, no files found
    

Now I surely must be able to remove the folder, right?

    
    
    $ DEL [.SSH]
    %DELETE-E-DELVER, explicit version number or wild card required
    

Sadly not. Reading through the [docs][6] I figured out the correct command to
recursively delete all files in a folder:

    
    
       $ DEL [.SSH]*.*;*
       $
    

The command fails the second time since there are no more files:

    
    
     $ DEL [.SSH]*.*;*
    %DELETE-W-SEARCHFAIL, error searching for EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE.SSH]*.*;*
    -RMS-E-FNF, file not found
    

If you happen to have subfolders, add the `/ERASE` flag to recursively delete
everything:

    
    
    $ DEL /ERASE [.SSH]*.*;*
    

### Finally the correct DEL syntax, permission error!

Reading the documentation page some more I figured out the correct syntax, no
brackets and no leading perion:

    
    
     $ DEL SSH.DIR;1
    %DELETE-W-FILNOTDEL, error deleting EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE]SSH.DIR;1
    -RMS-E-PRV, insufficient privilege or file protection violation
    

Different error message, so we're getting there. The manual states:

> This command requires delete (D) access to the file and write (W) access to
the parent directory.

Reading, again, the excellent [documentation][7] shows me that there is an `ACL`
system and a permission system. For now I tried the permission system first.

I figured out that `SHOW SECURITY` is the command to see the permissions.
Permissions on OpenVMS are very different as well from your standard *NIX
permissions.

    
    
     $ SHOW SECURITY SSH.DIR;1
    
    EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE]SSH.DIR;1 object of class FILE
         Owner: [EXAMPLE]
         Protection: (System: RWE, Owner: RWE, Group, World)
         Access Control List: <empty>
    

Using the `SET FILE` command we can explicitly add the `D` permission for the
`O` (Owner) , which is for deletion:

    
    
    $ SET FILE/PROTECTION=O:RWED SSH.DIR;1
    $
    

It did update the permissions:

    
    
    EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE]SSH.DIR;1 object of class FILE
         Owner: [EXAMPLE]
         Protection: (System: RWE, Owner: RWED, Group, World)
         Access Control List: <empty>
    

Would I now finally be able to remove this directory?

    
    
       $ DEL SSH.DIR;1
       $
    

Yay! No error message! And no more folder:

    
    
     $ dir [.SSH]
    %DIRECT-E-OPENIN, error opening EISNER$DRA3:[DECUSERVE_USER.EXAMPLE.SSH]*.*;* as input
    -RMS-E-DNF, directory not found
    -SYSTEM-W-NOSUCHFILE, no such file
    

### Conclusion

What have we learned today?

  * Syntax of the `DIR` command is not the same as for the `DEL` command, the latter does not require brackets and a leading period.
  * Directories must be empty before they can be removed
  * Removing all files in a folder is possible
  * Removing all directories and files recursively is also possible with the `/ERASE` flag
  * Deleting a directory requires the explicit `D` (DELETE) permission to be set on that folder

And still no OpenSSH Public key authentication. Enough OpenVMS for this evening,
SSH will be next.
