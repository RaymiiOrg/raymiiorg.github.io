This applescript locks the OS X Date and Time Preference Panel. It can be run
via Apple Remote Desktop. This is related to [CVE-2013-1775][1], a local sudo
root exploit on OS X. If the date and time preference panel is locked, setting
the date and time also requires a sudo password.

To exploit the bug you have to be in an administrative group and you have to
have used sudo before. OS X by default does not require extra authentication to
set the date for administrative users. Limited users are not able to do this.

    
    
    When a user successfully authenticates with sudo, a time stamp
    file is updated to allow that user to continue running sudo
    without requiring a password for a preset time period (five
    minutes by default).  The user's time stamp file can be reset
    using "sudo -k" or removed altogether via "sudo -K".
    
    A user who has sudo access and is able to control the local
    clock (common in desktop environments) can run a command via
    sudo without authenticating as long as they have previously
    authenticated themselves at least once by running "sudo -k" and
    then setting the clock to the epoch (1970-01-01 01:00:00).
    
    The vulnerability does not permit a user to run commands other
    than those allowed by the sudoers policy.

This script locks the date and time panel. When that is done, OS X requires a
password to change the date and time. It is an applescript, it checks if the
panel is locked or unlocked and if it is unlocked it locks it. It can also be
run via Apple Remote Desktop.

The Applescript:

    
    
    -- By R. van Elst
    -- License: GNU GPL v3 
    quit application "System Preferences"
    quit application "System Preferences"
    
    tell application "System Preferences"
        activate
        set current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.datetime"
    end tell
    
    
    tell application "System Events" to set frontmost of process "System Preferences" to true
    tell application "System Events"
        tell process "System Preferences"
            tell window 1
                --set titlell to title of button 4
                --display dialog titlell
                if title of button 4 is "Click the lock to prevent further changes." then
                    click button 4
                end if
            end tell
        end tell
    end tell
    quit application "System Preferences"
    

To run this via Apple Remote Desktop, select a machine and the run a UNIX
command on it. Make sure it runs as the currently logged in console user. Paste
this command in there:

    
    
    osascript << endofSCRIPT
    
    quit application "System Preferences"
    quit application "System Preferences"
    
    tell application "System Preferences"
        activate
        set current pane to pane id "com.apple.preference.datetime"
    end tell
    
    
    tell application "System Events" to set frontmost of process "System Preferences" to true
    tell application "System Events"
        tell process "System Preferences"
            tell window 1
                --set titlell to title of button 4
                --display dialog titlell
                if title of button 4 is "Click the lock to prevent further changes." then
                    click button 4
                end if
            end tell
        end tell
    end tell
    quit application "System Preferences"
    
    endofSCRIPT
    

This also works when the machine is locked. **[You do need to enable access for
assistive devices. Click this link to see how to do that via the command
line][4]

Another option is to configure sudo to ask for a password every time. Edit
`/etc/sudoers` and add the following:

    
    
    Defaults timestamp_timeout=0
