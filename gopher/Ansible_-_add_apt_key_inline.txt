Using the apt _key module one can add an APT key with ansible. You can get the
key from a remote server or from a file, or just a key ID. I got the request to
do some stuff on a machine which was quite rescricted (so no HKP protocol) and I
was asked not to place to many files on the machine. The apt_ key was needed but
it could not be a file, so using a YAML Literal Block Scalar I was able to add
the key inline in the playbook. Not the best way to do it, but one of the many
ways Ansible allows it.

### Literal Block Scalar

In the [Ansible documentation][2] we find the Literal Block Scalar:

> Values can span multiple lines using | or >. Spanning multiple lines using a
"Literal Block Scalar" | will include the newlines and any trailing spaces.

Since it's still YAML you do need to have the indentation correct.

### Example

In my case it is a playbook for MediaWiki, here's the code:

    
    
    - name: Ubuntu | Configuration | Add mediawiki apt key
      apt_key:

If you do not have the indentation correct, like this:

Ansible will complain and fail:

    
    
    ERROR! Syntax Error while loading YAML.
      could not find expected ':'
    
    The error appears to have been in '[...]roles/mediawiki/tasks/main.yml': line 8, column 1, but may
    be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.
    
    The offending line appears to be:
