This little bash script will let you do an action (or actions) in all
subdirectories of a folder. It is a small for loop, which I needed for a git
cleanup.

##### Git clean

I have all my git repositories in my ~/git folder. Sometimes those things grow
big and I run a `git gc` on them. Now I had not done that for a few weeks and my
git folder was getting huge. Git has a nice command, git gc, which clean up
stuff. I don't know how exactly, but I do know it works.

This command will find all directories, 1 level deep. Then it will go into them
(pushd), issue the command (git gc) and go back to the above directory (popd).

    
    
    remy@solaris3 $~/git: for D in `find . -maxdepth 1 -type d`; do pushd $D; echo "==> DIR ${D}, COMMAND: git gc"; git gc; popd; done
    

##### Other stuff

You can also use it for other things, like copy a license file to all your
software source code directories

    
    
    remy@solaris3 $~/git: for D in `find . -maxdepth 1 -type d`; do pushd $D; echo "==> DIR ${D}, COMMAND: cp ~/LICENSE ./"; cp ~/LICENSE ./; popd; done
    

You might want to zip all directories? Check if a file exists? What more to
think about?
