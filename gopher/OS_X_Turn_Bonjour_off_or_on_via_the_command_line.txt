This little snippet switches off Bonjour on OS X via the command line or Apple
Remote Desktop. This is useful when you want to disable iChat or Messages
chatting on the local network.

> Bonjour is Apple's implementation of Zero configuration networking (Zeroconf),
a group of technologies that includes service discovery, address assignment, and
hostname resolution. Bonjour locates devices such as printers, other computers,
and the services that those devices offer on a local network using multicast
Domain Name System (mDNS) service records.

To turn it off execute this command:

    
    
    defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder ProgramArguments -array-add "-NoMulticastAdvertisements"
    

To turn it on again:

    
    
    defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder ProgramArguments -array "/usr/sbin/mDNSResponder" "-launchd"
