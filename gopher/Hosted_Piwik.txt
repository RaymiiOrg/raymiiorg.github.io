# Important

As of 2018 I no longer have ownership of hosted-piwik.org. There were no active
signups for it and I stopped using Piwik myself, thus I cancelled the domain and
site.

**It now hosts malicious javascript** so if you've included the tracking code in
your sites, make sure to remove it. There is nothing I can do about it.
