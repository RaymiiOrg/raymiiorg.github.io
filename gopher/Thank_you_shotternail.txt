> Thank you, shotternail!

Recently I got a new Github Sponsor, a one-time donor. Often, 
these github profiles list a name, email address or some information
to contact the person, even a last-resort ssh key with a comment, 
but this profile has nothing. They joined
github 8 days ago, and I suspect it was just to do a donation to me.

Because I have no other way of communicating, here is a public post
to say thank you to [shotternail][1], whomever you are!

Note: I can send a Github Sponsors message, but that goes to all the sponsors,
and I don't want to bother the [other two sponsors, Jeff and Eric][2]. I can
filter by sponsorship tier, but not one-time sponsors only.

No public events or ssh keys:

	$ curl "https://api.github.com/users/shotternail/events/public"
	[

	]


	$ curl https://github.com/shotternail.keys
	[...] #nothing
