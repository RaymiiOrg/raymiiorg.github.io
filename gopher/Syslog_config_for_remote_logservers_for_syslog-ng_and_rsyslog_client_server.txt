> A Teletype ASR-33 printing system output

Syslog is the protocol, format (and software) linux and most networking devices
use to log messages. All kinds of messages, system, authentication, login and
applications. There are multiple implementations of syslog, like syslog-ng and
rsyslog. Syslog has the option to log to a remote server and to act as a remote
logserver (that receives logs). With a remote logging server you can archive
your logs and keep them secure (when a machine gets hacked, if root is
compromised the logs on the machine are no longer trustworthy). This tutorial
shows how to set up a syslog server with rsyslog and syslog-ng and shows how to
setup servers as a syslog client (that log to a remote server) with syslog-ng
and rsyslog.

### Server: rsyslog

rsyslog is the default syslog service on Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE and CentOS
(next to systemd's journald). The configuration syntax is simpler than syslog-
ng's, but complex configuration is more clear in syslog-ng. Bottom line they
both work just as well. The below steps are to be taken to setup rsyslog as a
syslog service to receive syslogs.

Edit the following file:

    
    
    vim /etc/rsyslog.d/10-remote.conf 
    

Add the following:

    
    
    $ModLoad imudp
    $UDPServerRun 514
    $AllowedSender UDP, 192.0.2.0/24
    
    $template RemoteStore, "/var/log/remote/%HOSTNAME%/%timegenerated:1:10:date-rfc3339%"
    :source, !isequal, "localhost" -?RemoteStore
    :source, isequal, "last" ~
    

This will allow all hosts in the subnet `192.0.2.0/24` to log to this machine.

Restart rsyslog to make the changes active:

    
    
    service rsyslog restart
    

The files will be placed in `/var/log/remote`, sorted on hostname. For example:

    
    
     ls -la /var/log/remote/server1.example.net/
    

Output:

    
    
    total 10G
    drwxr-xr-x 2 syslog syslog 4.0K Jun 19 08:44 .
    drwxr-xr-x 4 syslog syslog 4.0K Jun 13 13:54 ..
    -rw-r----- 1 syslog adm    2.6G Jun 14 23:59 2018-06-14
    -rw-r----- 1 syslog adm    2.5G Jun 15 23:59 2018-06-15
    -rw-r----- 1 syslog adm    1.4G Jun 16 23:59 2018-06-16
    -rw-r----- 1 syslog adm    1.3G Jun 17 23:59 2018-06-17
    -rw-r----- 1 syslog adm    1.1G Jun 18 23:59 2018-06-18
    -rw-r----- 1 syslog adm    1.5G Jun 19 16:23 2018-06-19
    

When you just configured a client, it will take some time (a few minutes) before
the logs and folder appear under `/var/log/remote`.

#### Logrotate

As you can see logging can take up some space, I recommend to setup logrotate
for this remote folder. You can do so on Ubuntu by creating the following
logrotate config file:

    
    
    vim /etc/logrotate.d/remote
    

Contents:

    
    
    /var/log/remote/*/*
    {
            rotate 90
            daily
            missingok
            compress
    }
    

This will compress and rotate logs every day and keep them for 90 days (3
months). To test your config, use the following command:

    
    
    logrotate -d --force /etc/logrotate.d/remote
    

(that will rotate all your logs, don't CTRL+C it otherwise your log folder will
be messed up)

You don't have to restart a service since logrotate is ran via cron
(`/etc/cron.daily/logrotate`).

### Client: rsyslog (Ubuntu)

On Ubuntu or any rsyslog server, to log to a remote syslogserver, add the
following to `rsyslog.conf`:

    
    
        *.*   @192.0.2.10:514
    

(Replace 192.0.2.10 with the IP or hostname of your syslog server)

The file can be either:

  * `/etc/rsyslog.conf`
  * `/etc/rsyslog.d/99-remote.conf`

Restart rsyslog to make the changes active:

    
    
    service rsyslog restart
    

### Server: syslog-ng

syslog-ng is the default on older versions of SUSE Enterprise Linux and OpenSUSE
next to systemd's journald and on [HP-UX][3]. Most older distro's use it as
well, Debian, Fedora and Arch all had it as their default years ago.

To set up syslog-ng as a remote log server that can receive logs, edit the
following file:

    
    
    vim /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf
    

Add or edit:

    
    
    source net { udp(); };
    destination remote { file("/var/log/remote/${FULLHOST}"); };
    log { source(net); destination(remote); };
    

This file can also be in `/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/` under a different name.
Restart syslog-ng to make the changes active:

    
    
    service syslog-ng restart
    

This will place the logfiles in `/var/log/remote`. As far as I could find in the
documentation, there is no option to limit on subnet like rsyslog has in the
above example. Use the firewall to allow access from different networks.

With syslog-ng it is also recommended to setup logrotate and compression. See
the rsyslog server section on how to do that.

### Client: syslog-ng

The setup for sending logs to a remote syslog server is simple. Edit the
`syslog-ng.conf` file:

    
    
    vim /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf
    

Add or edit the following:

    
    
    destination remote { network("192.0.2.10" transport("udp") port(514)); };
    

Older versions do not support the `network()` syntax, you need to use the older
`tcp()` or `udp()` syntax:

    
    
    destination remote { udp("192.0.2.10" port(514)); };
    

In both cases, replace `192.0.2.10` with your logserver's IP. (Unless you are
using `TEST-NET-1` of course).

This file can also be in `/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/` under a different name.
Restart syslog-ng to make the changes active:

    
    
    service syslog-ng restart
    

### What about systemd / journald?

Systemd and journald are taking over every part of your linux system including
logging. Most distro's supply a syslog service which journald (systemd's binary
logging component) forwards logs to. If your system is not set up like that, you
need to install either rsyslog or syslog-ng and tell journald to forward the
logs to syslog:

    
    
    vim /etc/systemd/journald.conf 
    

Add or change:

    
    
    ForwardToSyslog=yes
    

Restart journald:

    
    
    systemctl restart systemd-journald
    

If your syslog-ng or rsyslog version is recent enough, all journald logs will
now appear in syslog as well.
