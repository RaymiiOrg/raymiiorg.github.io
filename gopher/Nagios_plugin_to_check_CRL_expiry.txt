This is a nagios plugin which you can use to check if a CRL (Certificate
Revocation List, public list with revoked certificates) is still valid. This is
based on the check_crl.py plugin from [Michele Baldessari][1]. It is modified it
so that it checks the time in minutes (for more precision) instead of days, it
has a GMT time comparison bug fixed and I've added error handling so that if the
plugin cannot get a crl file (because the webserver is down) it gives a Critical
error in nagios.

#### Install and Usage

This guide covers the steps needed for Ubuntu 10.04/12.04 and Debian 6. It
should also work on other distro's, but make sure to modify the commands where
needed.

Make sure you have openssl, python3 and a module needed by the script installed
on the nagios host:

    
    
    apt-get install python3 openssl python-m2crypto
    

Now place the script on the host. I've placed in _/etc/nagios/plugins/check_
crl.py_.

    
    
    wget -O /etc/nagios/plugins/check_crl.py http://raymii.org/s/inc/downloads/check_crl.py
    

Make sure the script is executable:

    
    
    chmod +x /etc/nagios/plugins/check_crl.py
    

Now test the script. I'm using the URL of the Comodo CA CRL file which is the CA
that signed my certificate for raymii.org.

    
    
    /etc/nagios/plugins/check_crl.py -u http://crl.comodoca.com/PositiveSSLCA2.crl -w 480 -c 360
    OK CRL Expires in 5109 minutes (on Thu May  9 07:30:32 2013 GMT)
    
    /etc/nagios/plugins/check_crl.py -u http://crl.comodoca.com/PositiveSSLCA2.crl -w 5200 -c 360
    WARNING CRL Expires in 5108 minutes (on Thu May  9 07:30:32 2013 GMT)
    
    /etc/nagios/plugins/check_crl.py -u http://crl.comodoca.com/PositiveSSLCA2.crl -w 5000 -c 5300
    CRITICAL CRL Expires in 5108 minutes (on Thu May  9 07:30:32 2013 GMT)
    

Lets add the nagios command:

    
    
    define command{
        command_name    crl_check
        command_line    /etc/nagios-plugins/check_crl.py -u $ARG1$ -w $ARG2$ -c $ARG3$
    }
    

And lets add the command to a service check:

    
    
    define service {
            use                             generic-service
            host_name                       localhost
            service_description             Comodo PositiveSSL CA2 CRL
            contact                         nagiosadmin                 
            check_command                   crl_check!http://crl.comodoca.com/PositiveSSLCA2.crl!24!12
    }
    

The above service check runs on the nagios defined host "localhost", uses the
(default) service template "generic-service" and had the contact "nagiosadmin".
As you can see, the URL maps to $ARG1$, the warning hours to $ARG2$ and the
critical hours to $ARG3$. This means that if the field _"Next Update:"_ is less
then 8 hours in the future you get a warning and if it is less then 6 hours you
get a critical.

#### Changelog
