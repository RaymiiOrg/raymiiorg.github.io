This post will show you how to set up the Munin plugin to monitor
NGINX (`nginx_request` and `nginx_status`) and graph it. You need to change some
URLs in the config because by default this is wrong.

For this tutorial you need to have a munin server and a NGINX server. All
commands need to be run as root or a superuser.

First enable the nginx status page:

    
    
    ## Edit your nginx configuration (vhost) and add this in a server {} block
    location /nginx_status {
        stub_status on;
        access_log off;
        allow 127.0.0.1;
        deny all;
    }
    

The above config will enable the status module only for the localhost, without
access logging. This means that nobody other than munin can access the status
page.

Execute this command to change the munin configuration to have the correct
URL for the plugin:

    
    if [[ $(cat /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node | grep "nginx") = "" ]]; then echo -e "\n[nginx*]\nenv.url http://localhost/nginx_status" >> /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node; fi
    

Then configure the munin plugins:

    
    munin-node-configure --suggest --shell | sh
    

This creates the symlinks in the `/etc/munin/plugins/` folder. If they are note
there, `ln -s` them yourself.

Finally restart munin:
   
    
    /etc/init.d/munin-node restart
    

Done. You will now have nice nginx ghraps like below:
