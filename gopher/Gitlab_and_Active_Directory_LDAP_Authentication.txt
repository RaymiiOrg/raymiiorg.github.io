Gitlab is a self hosted git based source control application similar to Github,
written in Ruby on Rails. It is used by many organisations and is a wonderfull
piece of software. It supports LDAP Authentication (via the OmniAuth Gem), but
it is tricky to set up with Active Directory and Windows Server 2003/2008/2012.
This tutorials shows you how to set up Gitlab to authenticate against Active
Directory LDAP.

You have to have a working Gitlab installation for this. It is tested with
Gitlab 3 and up to 5.2, with an Active Directory 2008 env, and a Mixed 2008 &
2003 AD. Gitlab is installed on a Ubuntu box.

First create a user in the Active Directory. My CN is Users, and my user is
named `gitlab`. It does not have any special permissions, it is just a normal
user. Note the Full Name you use, in my example it is "Gitlab LDAP". See the
image below for an example:

![windows-gitlab][2]

Now go to your Gitlab server, log in and become the git user:

    
    
    sudo su - git
    

And edit the `~/gitlab/config/gitlab.yml` file. (Assuming you followed the
official installation guide, otherwise adapt path.). The relevant LDAP section
should contain this:

    
    
      ldap:
        enabled: true
        host: 'pdc1.domain.tld'
        base: 'CN=Users,DC=Domain,DC=tld'
        port: 389
        uid: 'sAMAccountName'
        method: 'plain' # or "ssl"
        bind_dn: 'CN=Gitlab LDAP,CN=Users,DC=Domain,DC=tld'
        password: 'example_password'
    

It took me a while to find the correct `bind_dn` and `base_dn`. It appears that
they are capital sensitive, `cn=Users` would not work, but `CN=Users` does.
Also, the `bind_dn` does not use the users email address, but the `Display
Name`. So `CN=gitlab@domain.tld` does not work, but `CN=Gitlab LDAP` does.

Hope this helps you setting up Gitlab with LDAP auth. More info on Gitlab can be
found on their website: <http://gitlab.org/>.
