This guide shows you how download Openstack Images to your local machine using
the command line Glance client. You can use this, for example, to download a
copy of an image created from a VM, or to download the images your Openstack
provider provides and adapt those.

You can see all my [Openstack related articles here][1]. For example, how to use

### Command Line tools

Make sure you have the Openstack command line tools installed. Follow the
official openstack guide [here][4]. If you have `pip` installed you can use that
to install the tools:

    
    
    pip install python-novaclient
    pip install python-cinderclient
    pip install python-glanceclient
    pip install python-keystoneclient
    pip install python-neutronclient
    pip install python-swiftclient
    

Save yourself some time and create a file named `computerc` with the below
contents:

    
    
    export OS_AUTH_URL="https://identity.stack.cloudvps.com/v2.0"
    export OS_TENANT_NAME="<tenant name>"
    export OS_USERNAME="<username>"
    export OS_PASSWORD="<password>"
    export OS_TENANT_ID="<tenant id>"
    

When you are going to do stuff with the Openstack command line clients, load
this file:

    
    
    source computerc
    

That way, your authentication data are loaded and you don't have to give
parameters like `--os-username` and such.

### Openstack Overview

Openstack is a datacenter virtualization plaform consisting out of many
different tools and services. Here is a short overview of the different services
you might encounter.

#### Compute (Nova)

This is the virtualization service. It works with a hypervisor to create and
manage virtual machines. You can create a VM based on a specific "Flavour",
which is just a definition of specs like disk, cpu and ram.

#### Block Storage (Cinder)

This is the service which makes block devices (volumes) available to services. A
flavour can not be changed, just resized. If you want extra storage you need to
create a volume, attach it to the VM and mount it there for use.

#### Images (Glance)

This is the service which holds all the images. Images can be used to boot a VM
from. Images can be prepared with tools like `cloud-init` to make them behave
better in a cloud environment, for example, setting an SSH key or password at
boot.

### Listing images

When you've created a `computerc` file and loaded it up in your shell you can
start the process. You need the UUID of the image you want to download. Get a
list of all images using the `glance image-list` command:

    
    
    $ glance image-list
    

Output:

    
    
    +------------+---------------------+--------+-----------+------------+--------+
    | ID         | Name                | Disk   | Container | Size       | Status |
    +------------+---------------------+--------+-----------+------------+--------+
    | 0a[...]5dd | example-test        | raw    | bare      | 4843700224 | active |
    | 13[...]b30 | example-2           | qcow2  | bare      | 4762632192 | active |
    | 22[...]eeb | FreeBSD-10.1        | qcow2  | bare      | 736981504  | active |
    | d2[...]625 | pfSense 2.1.5       | iso    | bare      | 403243008  | active |
    +------------+---------------------+--------+-----------+------------+--------+
    

The `ID` part is what you need. In this example it is trimmed.

### Download Image

Use the `glance image-download` command to download the image. By default it
will go to STDOUT, use the `--file` parameter to place the output in a file.

    
    
    $ glance image-download --file ./example-test.img 0a[...]5dd
    

The command syntax is:

    
    
    $ glance image-download --file $FILENAME $UUID
    

If you get the following error:

    
    
    object of type 'generator' has no len()
    

Try executing the command without the `--progress` option.
