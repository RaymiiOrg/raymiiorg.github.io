This command lets you turn the build in OS X firewall on and off, on both for
specific services or essential services. It works with OS X 10.5, 10.6, 10.7 and
10.8. It also works via Apple Remote Desktop.

To turn the firewall _off_ :

    
    
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf globalstate -int 0
    

To turn the firewall _on for specific applications/services_ :

    
    
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf globalstate -int 1
    

To turn the firewall _on for essential services like DHCP and ipsec, block all
the rest_ :

    
    
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf globalstate -int 2
