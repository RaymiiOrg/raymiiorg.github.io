I mostly get my wallpapers from the website [Wallbase.cc][1]. But the site
requires a lot of javascript and ajax, and it is hard to get a lot of wallpapers
at once. I've written a script for this problem, it lets you grep wallbase from
the cli!

##### Features

  * Bash, wget, awk only, nothing else required (well, active internet connection)
  * Get the newest wallpapers from wallbase.cc
  * Search for a term and get all the wallpapers from the first page at wallbase.cc
  * Get random wallpapers
  * Duplicate check, removes duplicate wallpapers (filesize && md5sum)

##### Usage

Very simple, first copy and paste the script into a file (wall.sh) and chmod
that so that you can execute it. chmod +x ./wall.sh ./wall.sh r for random
./wall.sh n for newest ./wall.sh s TERM for search TERM.

So to download forest wallpapers: ./wall.sh s forest

If you want to get a lot of random wallpapers then execute this: while true; do
./wall.sh r; sleep 1; done and kill that afet 10 minutes...
