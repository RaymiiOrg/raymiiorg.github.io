This site is generated with my self-written open source static site generator
named [ingsoc][2] (named after 1984). I've updated the layout of the website
to be less cluttered, allowing you to get to the content much faster.

Inspired by my recent [gopher][3] adventures I decided to do away with the
2 column layout (drop the sidebar with menu) and have a smaller header with
essential links. On mobile this makes a huge difference in scrolling, on the
desktop it looks less cluttered.

The [Gopher][9] site is just a list of articles with a nice header and a few
links to the about page and other [Gopherholes][10]. I wanted to replicate that
layout on the web site, but with a little bit of styling to make it look nicer 
than just plain text.

If you read these site update articles, please [let me know][14]. I'd like to
hear your opinion on the new layout.

I sometimes write updates on new changes in ingsoc, those articles can be found  
[here][1]. The last large layout update was [over a year ago][8].


### Mobile side by side

The previous layout was reasonably responsive, it scaled to smaller devices.
The menu and sidebar appeared before the actual content on mobile, requiring you
to scroll down quite a bit. The current layout has the content right there.

### Desktop side by side

On the desktop the sidebar with the menu and sponsors has disappeared. It's now
in the header. The sponsor image is replaced by text in the articles. 

This was the previous layout:

![previous][5]

This is the current layout:

![current][6]

### Small improvements

The overview page now has a count:

![count][11]

If an article is updated after publishing, this is now shown, both on the site
as well as the RSS feed:

![lastupdate][12]

The tags for an item are now comma seperated and the search bar has moved down:
