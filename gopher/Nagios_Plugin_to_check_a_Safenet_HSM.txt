functional module information.

### Usage

    
    
    usage: ./hsm.sh options
    
    This script checks various safenet HSM things and outputs nagios style results.
    
    OPTIONS:
       -h      Show this message
       -t      Check type: "battery", "RAM", "datetime", "eventlog", "initialized", "hsminfo", "fminfo"
       -n      HSM name for $ET_HSM_NETCLIENT_SERVERLIST.
       -b      ctcheck binary (default: /opt/PTK/bin/ctcheck)
    
    CHECKS:
       battery          Show HSM Battery status, GOOD (ok) or LOW (crit)
       ram              HSM RAM, (ok) if <75% used, (warn) >75% <85% used, (crit) if >85% used.
       datetime         Local HSM date/time, (crit) if different from host time, host should use ntp in same timezone.
       eventlog         (ok) if eventlog not full, (crit) if eventlog full.
       initialized      (ok) if initialized, (crit) if not. Documentation states that a FALSE could mean a tampered device.
       hsminfo          always (ok), returns general HSM info, model, version, firmware and such.
       fminfo           always (ok), returns Functional Module information.
    

### Examples

    
    
    user@host ~$ ./hsm.sh -n hsm-038 -t ram
    OK: RAM Usage OK: 41% used, ( 10192256 total). HSM: hsm-038.
    user@host ~$ ./hsm.sh -n hsm-038 -t datetime
    OK: HSM: hsm-038 time is the same as local time: 15/04/2013 12:48.
    user@host ~$ ./hsm.sh -n hsm-038 -t eventlog
    OK: HSM: hsm-038 Event Log Count: 11
    user@host ~$ ./hsm.sh -n hsm-038 -t initialized
    OK: HSM: hsm-038 is initialized. All is well.
    user@host ~$ ./hsm.sh -n hsm-038 -t hsminfo
    OK: HSM: hsm-038; Serial Number:[...]; Model: [...]; Device Revision: F; Firmware Revision: [...]; Manufacturing Date: [...]; Device Batch: [...]; PTKC Revision: [...]; Slot Count: [...] Security Mode: [...]; Transport Mode:[...]; Event Log Count: 88.
    user@host ~$ ./hsm.sh -n hsm-038 -t battery
    OK: Battery status is good for HSM: hsm-038
