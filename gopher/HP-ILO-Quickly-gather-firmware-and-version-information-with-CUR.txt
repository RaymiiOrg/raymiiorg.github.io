Have a lot of HP servers with ILO cards, and want to gather information from
them quicly? By default you can get some information in XML format, for ILO,
ILO2, ILO3 and ILO4, with curl. You don't have to log in via SSH, and can script
it/loop it.

On the command line, make sure you're in the right VLAN/management network
(replace the IP with your ILO IP) :

    
    
    curl http://10.2.76.22/xmldata?item=All
    

For https:

    
    
    curl -k https://10.2.76.22/xmldata?item=All
    

Example response:

    
    
    <?xml version="1.0"?><RIMP><HSI><SBSN>CZCxxxx </SBSN><SPN>ProLiant DL380 G5</SPN><UUID>xxxxxxxx</UUID><SP>1</SP><cUUID>0000-0000-0000-0000</cUUID><VIRTUAL><STATE>Inactive</STATE><VID><BSN></BSN><cUUID></cUUID></VID></VIRTUAL></HSI><MP><ST>1</ST><PN>Integrated Lights-Out 2 (iLO 2)</PN><FWRI>2.02</FWRI><BBLK>3; Jul 11 2004</BBLK><HWRI>ASIC:  7</HWRI><SN>00xx00xx00xx      </SN><UUID>ILO000xxx000</UUID><IPM>1</IPM><SSO>0</SSO><PWRM>3.4</PWRM></MP></RIMP>
    

A quick tip, to know the ILO version look at the `HWRI>ASIC:` value:

  * ASIC 2 = ILO 1
  * ASIC 7 = ILO 2
  * ASIC 16 = ILO 4

With curl you can loop as well:

    
    
    curl http://10.2.76.[1-120]/xmldata?item=All
    

Also, here is a script to find all the ILO's on your network:
