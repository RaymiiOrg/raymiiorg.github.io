for Ansible.

### Installation

Install PySphere:

    
    
    pip install -U pysphere
    

Edit the script's login data and VCenter server FQDN:

    
    
    server_fqdn = "vcenter.example.org"
    server_username = "jdoe"
    server_password = "secure_passw0rd"
    

### Test it:

Get all powered on VM's:

    
    
    python2 query.py --list
    

Output:

    
    
    {
        "no_group": {
            "hosts": [
                "vm0031",
                "vm0032",
                [...]
                "vm0999"
            ]
        },
        "local": [
            "127.0.0.1"
        ]
    }
    

Get one VM:

    
    
    python2 query.py --host vm0032
    

Output:

    
    
    {
        "admin": "sysadmin@example.org",
        "source_database": "VMWare"
    }
    

Nonexistent VM:

    
    
    python2 query.py --host nonexist
    

Output:

    
    
    [Error]: [Object Not Found]: Could not find a VM named 'notexist'
    

Do a simple ansible ping:

    
    
    ANSIBLE_HOSTS="/home/remy/git/vmware-ansible/query.py" ansible all -m ping
    

Result:

    
    
    vm0032 | success >> {
        "changed": false,
        "ping": "pong"
    }
    
    vm0034 | success >> {
        "changed": false,
        "ping": "pong"
    }
    

### Usage

Either export the ANSIBLE_HOSTS variable to always use the VMWare inventory:

    
    
    export ANSIBLE_HOSTS="/home/remy/git/vmware-ansible/query.py"
    

Or preface each ansible command:

    
    
    ANSIBLE_HOSTS="/home/remy/git/vmware-ansible/query.py" ansible all -m apt -a "upgrade=safe"
    

### Notes

Tested with both vCenter 5.1 and 5.5, Python 2.

Does not support grouping by datacenter or resource group
