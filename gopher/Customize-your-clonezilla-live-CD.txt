At work we need to image laptops. We do that with clonezilla.  
But some people think the clonezilla menu is to hard. So A colleague and I made
a script to do it in 2 steps (mount and enter image name).  
But that had to be integrated in to the clonezilla live CD.  
That is a pain to do if you're on a windows vista PC.  
But it worked, and I wanted to share it with the rest of the world.  
Our script to backup can be found at the bottom of the page.  
But how do I get that script on to the live USB?

This is how I do it:

    
    
    mkdir rw.fs  
    mkdir clonscript  
    (above is only required once).  
    mount -t unionfs -o dirs=rw.fs=rw:/mnt=ro unionfs clonscript  
    cd clonscript  
    mkdir clondir1  
    copy the scripts, or nano them.  
    (To launch a clonezilla script as root, make a launcher script, and put this in it:  
    *#!/bin/sh  
    sudo su -c /path/to/script/you/just/made.sh*  
    cd ../../  
    umount clonscript  
    mksquashfs ./rw.fs ./filesystem.squashfs
    

Now the 2 filesystems are being put together.  
The next time, mount it again, make a new directory (say clondir2) and cp all
the scripts from clondir1 into clondir2, and edit them from there. Also change
your root launch script to the new dir.

Now edit the isolinux/isolinux.cfg file. To start a script as root,  
make a link to it as described earlier. Here is my setup:

    
    
    * label RESTORE  
    # MENU DEFAULT  
    # MENU HIDE  
    MENU LABEL RESTORE  
    # MENU PASSWD  
    kernel /live/vmlinuz1  
    append initrd=/live/initrd1.img boot=live union=aufs  
    hostname=jaunty edd=on nolocales ocs_live_run="/path/to/your/root/launcher/script.sh"  
    ocs_live_extra_param="" ocs_live_keymap="NONE" ocs_live_batch="no"  
    ocs_lang="" noprompt mode_option=800x600 toram=filesystem.squashfs  
    ip=frommedia  
    TEXT HELP  
    TEST RESTORE  
    ENDTEXT  
    *  
    

Note this part: ocs _live_ run="/path/to/your/root/launcher/script.sh". Change
that every time you make a change to the script. (For every change to the script
you make you must make a new directory and change your root launcher script.
This is because your merging a read only file system. And read only cannot be
overwritten.) Now make an ISO of it again. (At work I need to use the tool  
folder2iso [which can be downloaded here.][1]

after you made the ISO, unetbootin it to USB or burn it to CD.

You can remove the USB stick or CD when clonezilla is imaging, because this boot
script loads it into the ram.

If this can be done with less work, please post it in a comment, I hate this
way... (first start fcking vista, then virtualbox a mint, then share a folder,
then mount and edit, then folder2iso and at last unetbootin...)... And thanks to
the people of clonezilla for making such a wonderfull alternative to ghost and
acronis ^.^

##### Example Backup Script

    
    
    #!/bin/sh  
    dhclient  
    echo "###############################"  
    echo "# Script made by Remy & David #"  
    echo "###############################"  
    echo  
    echo  
    echo Voer nu het wachtwoord van de laptop in   
    echo  
    mount -t cifs -o username="daniel" //192.168.1.2/image /home/partimag  
    echo  
    echo  
    echo "Er komt nu een lijst met images"  
    echo "IMAGES: "  
    ls -n /home/partimag  
    echo  
    echo -n "Voer de naam van het image in(schoon#): "; read NAME;  
    /opt/drbl/sbin/ocs-sr -q -c -z1 -p true saveparts "$NAME" "sda2"
