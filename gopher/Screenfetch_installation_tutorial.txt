This tutorial will show you how to install screenfetch, a bash information tool.
It displays handy system information at login, including distro name, kernel,
uptime, cpu, ram and nice distro-based artwork. The tutorial includes support
for bash and zsh, for every supported linux OS (ubuntu, centos, arch, redhat,
solusOS, linux mint and more.)

### What is screenfetch?

    
    
    screenFetch is a "Bash Screenshot Information Tool". This handy Bash script can be used to generate one of those nifty terminal theme information + ASCII distribution logos you see in everyone's screenshots nowadays. It will auto-detect your distribution and display an ASCII version of that distribution's logo and some valuable information to the right. There are options to specify no ascii art, colors, taking a screenshot upon displaying info, and even customizing the screenshot command! This script is very easy to add to and can easily be extended.
    

### How does it look?

Here are two images from my VPS servers, for root, a normal user, both in `zsh`
and `bash`.

#### Debian

### Download

https://github.com/KittyKatt/screenFetch

### Installation

Make sure git is installed!

Clone the repo:

    
    
    cd /tmp
    git clone git://github.com/KittyKatt/screenFetch.git screenfetch
    

Install the script:

    
    
    sudo cp screenfetch/screenfetch-dev /usr/bin/screenfetch
    sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/screenfetch
    

Test it:

    
    
    screenfetch
    

If it works, add it to your shell:

Edit either `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, depends on which shell you use and add
the following at the bottom:

    
    
    if [ -f /usr/bin/screenfetch ]; then screenfetch; fi
    

Now logout and log back in, you will have a beautiful welcoming information
prompt!
