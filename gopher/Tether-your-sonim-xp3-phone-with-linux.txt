This guide works for the Sonim XP3.20 Quest (Pro).  
I also have an Android Phone which had an option to share the Internet
Connection via USB and/or Wifi.  
This was one of the features I missed on the Sonim. The phone itself is awesome,
but that is not in the scope of this guide.

It is also tested with the newer Sonim XP1300 Core. Please note that some
providers not allow you to tether your phones internet connection, and this may
cost you a lot of money if you go over your monthly bundle. Also you need to
have internet setup on your phone already. This guide was written and tested on
**Arch Linux with Kernel 2.6.36-ARCH** , but I think it will be usable on more
distributions.  
First install wvdial:

    
    
    pacman -S wvdial
    

Then plugin you Sonim and see on which tty it is detected:

    
    
    dmesg | grep tty 
    

You need to see something like this:

    
    
    cdc_acm 5-1:1.1: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
    usbcore: registered new interface driver cdc_acm
    cdc_acm: v0.26:USB Abstract Control Model driver for USB modems and ISDN adapters
    scsi 8:0:0:0: Direct-Access     Philips  Dev. 0 LUN 0     1.0  PQ: 0 ANSI: 0 
    

Now we have the tty (/dev/ttyACM0). This is all we need for the wvdial.conf
file:

    
    
    sudo nano /etc/wvdial.conf 
    

Paste this in there:

    
    
    [Dialer Defaults]
    Modem = /dev/ttyACM0
    Modem Type = Analog Modem
    ISDN = 0
    Baud = 115200
    Username = tmobile
    Password = tmobile
    Init1 = ATZ
    Init2 = AT&&F E1 V1 X1 &&D2 &&C1 S0=0
    Dial Attempts = 1
    
    [Dialer internet]
    Phone = *99***1#
    Stupid Mode = 1
    Init3 = AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","internet" 
    

My provider is T-Mobile NL, and their APN is "internet", with login "tmobile"
and password: "tmobile".

Change any of these values to your needs, look for them on your providers
website. Now save with CTRL+O and quit with CTRL+X, and see if it works:

    
    
    sudo wvdial internet 
    

Result:

    
    
    [remy@solaris3 ~]$ sudo wvdial internet
    --> WvDial: Internet dialer version 1.61
    --> Cannot get information for serial port.
    --> Initializing modem.
    --> Sending: ATZ
    ATZ
    OK
    --> Sending: AT&&F E1 V1 X1 &&D2 &&C1 S0=0
    AT&&F E1 V1 X1 &&D2 &&C1 S0=0
    OK
    --> Sending: AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","internet"
    AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","internet"
    OK
    --> Modem initialized.
    --> Sending: ATDT*99***1#
    --> Waiting for carrier.
    ATDT*99***1#
    CONNECT
    ~[7f]}#@!}!}!} }2}"}&&} }*} } }#}$@#}'}"}(}"U[03]~
    --> Carrier detected.  Starting PPP immediately.
    --> Starting pppd at Thu Jan 13 23:20:32 2012
    --> Pid of pppd: 14319
    --> Using interface ppp0

    --> remote IP address 10.32.32.32
    --> primary   DNS address 8.8.8.8
    --> secondary DNS address 8.8.4.4 
    

Bazinga! You can now surf via your Sonim phone via your 3g / 2g / egde or GSM
connection. (Check via /sbin/ifconfig).
