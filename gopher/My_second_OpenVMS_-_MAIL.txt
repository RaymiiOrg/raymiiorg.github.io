[![openvms][1]][2]

(You can read all my OpenVMS articles by [clicking the picture above][2])

Last week I registered myself with the [DECUServe OpenVMS][3] system. I found
out how to [navigate the filesystem and create files and folders][4], it was
awesome.

This week I learned how to use the OpenVMS `MAIL` program to read and reply to
an email I got from George Cornelius, another user on the [DECUServe system][3]

<p class="ad"> <a href="https://leafnode.nl">I'm developing a desktop monitoring app,  Leaf Node Monitoring, open source, but paid. For Windows, Linux & Android, go check it out.</a><br><br> <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/RaymiiOrg/">Consider sponsoring me on Github. It means the world to me if you show your appreciation and you'll help pay the server costs.</a><br><br> <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=7435ae6b8212">You can also sponsor me by getting a Digital Ocean VPS. With this referral link you'll get $100 credit for 60 days. </a><br><br> </p>


### MAIL

This blog item was put together using HP Enterprise's [online documentation][6]
on the `MAIL` program.

I saw that George had send me an email, after we had a chat using the OpenVMS
phone program. See my [earlier][4] article on that.

Login to your OpenVMS system and open the `MAIL` program:

    
    
     $ mail
    
    You have 1 new message.
    
    MAIL>
    

If you have new mail, you can just press `ENTER` on this prompt to read the
first new email:

    
    
    #1          29-MAR-2018 03:52:33.56                                  NEWMAIL
    From:   EISNER::CORNELIUS    "George Cornelius"
    To:     EXAMPLE
    CC:     CORNELIUS
    Subj:   Hello again
    
    Good talking with you, Remy.
    
    [...]
    
    MAIL>
    

To see an overview of all your messages, enter the `DIR` command at the `MAIL>`
prompt:

    
    
    MAIL> DIR
                                                                             NEWMAIL
          # From                 Date         Subject
    
          1 EISNER::CORNELIUS    29-MAR-2018  Hello again
    
    MAIL>
    

To open messages, just press `ENTER` and the first message opens. Keep pressing
`ENTER` to read all messages. When no more messages are available, the following
message will be displayed:

    
    
    MAIL>
    %MAIL-E-NOMOREMSG, no more messages
    

### Reply

To reply to a message, when opened, type `REPLY` at the mail prompt:

    
    
    To:     EISNER::CORNELIUS
    Subj:   RE: Hello again
    Enter your message below. Press CTRL/Z when complete, or CTRL/C to quit:
    

When you're done typing your message, press CTRL+Z to send it:

    
    
    (CTRL+Z)
    Press RETURN to continue reading your mail
    
    MAIL>
    

### Send mail

At the `MAIL>` prompt, type `SEND` to start the interactive mail send program:

    
    
     $ mail
    
    MAIL> send
    To:     USERNAME
    Subj:   Test message
    Enter your message below. Press CTRL/Z when complete, or CTRL/C to quit:
    Hi USERNAME,
    
    This is a test message since I'm now trying to figure out the mail program.
    
    Hope you're doing well.
    
    Cheers,
    Remy
    (CTRL+Z)  Exit
    
    MAIL>
    

To send a message to an actual email address, type their full email address at
the `To:` prompt.

From the [DECUS system][3], it will arrive:

![][7]

A reply will show up in your OpenVMS shell:

    
    
     $ 
    New mail on node EISNER from IN%"example@example.nl"  "Remy van Elst"
    

From Google Apps the email looks a bit messed up due to all the headers:

    
    
     $ mail
    
    You have 1 new message.

### Conclusion

Yay! Another OpenVMS facility I found out and used. I love this system, since
1977 it is rocking and still going strong!
