This tutorial will show you how to setup completely silent apt-get upgrade via
cron. It also defaults to not overwriting config files if a package has a newer
version.

on your own risk.

apt-get can be ran from a cronjob with different options to let it update
everything without asking questions. However, the regular combination as seen
below still mails output (and thus, not upgrades) when a changed file is found
in a package, for example, the _/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf_ file.

This is example output of such a situation:

    
    
    apt-get upgrade -y --force-yes -qq
    
    Configuration file `/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf'
    ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
    ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
    What would you like to do about it ? Your options are:
    Y or I : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O : keep your currently-installed version
    D : show the differences between the versions
    Z : background this process to examine the situation
    The default action is to keep your current version.
    *** lighttpd.conf (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? 
    

The apt-get command is ran from cron, and the below lines are mailed.

#### The solution

Using a few options for DPKG results in this command:

    
    
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive DEBIAN_PRIORITY=critical apt-get -q -y -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confdef" -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confold" upgrade
    

Results in this cronjob:

    
    
    1 1 * * * DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive DEBIAN_PRIORITY=critical sudo apt-get -q -y -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confdef" -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confold" dist-upgrade
    

And if you also want to update the apt-cache:

    
    
    1 3 * * * DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive DEBIAN_PRIORITY=critical sudo apt-get -q -y -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confdef" -o "Dpkg::Options::=--force-confold" dist-upgrade
    1 1 * * * apt-get -y update
