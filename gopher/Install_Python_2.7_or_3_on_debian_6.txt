Debian 6 by default ships with python 2.6.6. If for some reason need a newer
version of python you can either mess with repo's, compile from source or use
pythonbrew. This tutorial will show you how to install python 2.7 or 3 under
debian 6 using pythonbrew.

### What is pythonbrew

> pythonbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of Python in
the users $HOME. pythonbrew is inspired by [perlbrew][2] and [rvm][3].  
>  [More info about pythonbrew][4]

### Install pip

We first need to install pip, which we will use to install pythonbrew:

    
    
    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    

### Install pythonbrew

We now use pip to install pythonbrew

    
    
    sudo pip install pythonbrew
    

Now we finish the install of pythonbrew as it instructs us:

    
    
    pythonbrew_install
    

Then we make sure the pythonbrew files are loaded in our shell:

    
    
    source "$HOME/.pythonbrew/etc/bashrc"
    

### Install python 2.7

We can now instruct pythonbrew to install and compile python 2.7 for us:

    
    
    pythonbrew install 2.7.3
    

This takes a while, it will go and compile python for you. When it it finished,
we can tell our shell to use the freshly installed python:

    
    
    pythonbrew use 2.7.3
    

### Install python 3

To install python 3, we execute the following command. Note that this may take a
while, because it compiles python:

    
    
    pythonbrew install 3.2
    

To use this python, execute the following command:

    
    
    pythonbrew use 3.2
    

### Pythonbrew extra's

List all installed pythons:

    
    
    pythonbrew list
    

List the available installation pythons:

    
    
    pythonbrew list -k
    

Uninstall a python version (2.7.3 for this example):

    
    
    pythonbrew uninstall 2.7.3
    

Clean up stale source folders and archives:

    
    
    pythonbrew cleanup
