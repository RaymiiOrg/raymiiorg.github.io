                <title>Yocto boot2qt for the Seeed reTerminal (Qt 6)</title>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Yocto_boot2qt_for_the_Seeed_reTerminal_qt6.html</guid>
                <description>In this guide we'll build a linux distribution for Seeed reTerminal, using the Yocto project and the `boot2qt` stack provided by Qt. This `boot2qt` image can be written to the internal eMMC and when booted up, the Seeed reTerminal runs a software stack that integrates nicely with Qt Creator (the Qt IDE), for example, one click deployment to the device. You can run your own Qt application on the reTerminal, full screen, it will boot right into it.
This guide covers Qt 6.2. The guide also covers changing the default startup app to your own app, Qt Creator integration and rotating your Qt app, both Widgets and QML, the latter via Wayland and Weston.</description>

                <title>Build a WeatherTerminal app for the Seeed reTerminal (with Qt 6 &amp; QML)</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Qt_QML_WeatherTerminal_app_for_the_Seeed_reTerminal.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Qt_QML_WeatherTerminal_app_for_the_Seeed_reTerminal.html</guid>
                <description>In this guide I'll show you how to build a weather app for the Seeed reTerminal using Qt and QML. Imagine the reTerminal in your entrance hallway and with just a quick glance at the screen you'll know what the weather will be the next few hours, if you need an umbrella, if you'll have a headwind on your bicycle ride or if it's just going to be clear and sunny. This tutorial builds on the [reTerminal Yocto boot2qt distro](/s/tutorials/Yocto_boot2qt_for_the_Seeed_reTerminal_qt6.html) we've built in the previous article and uses Qt 6. Qt is a C++ framework, but this Weather app will use QML almost exclusively. I'm using just QML to make the guide more accessible and also because I'm used to doing everything in C++, so a sidestep to QML is fun for me as well. </description>

                <title>Yocto boot2qt for the Raspberry Pi 4, both Qt 5.15 and 6.2</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Yocto_boot2qt_for_the_Raspberry_Pi_4_both_Qt_6_and_Qt_5.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link>

                <description>In this guide we'll build a linux distribution for Raspberry Pi 4, using the Yocto project and the `boot2qt` stack provided by Qt. This `boot2qt` image can be written to an SD card and when booted up, the Raspberry Pi runs a software stack that integrates nicely with Qt Creator (the Qt IDE), for example, one click deployment to the device. You can run your own Qt application on the Pi, full screen, it will boot right into it.
This guide covers both Qt 5.15 and Qt 6.2. The 5.15 build process is a bit convoluted due to a few upstream issues. The guide also covers changing the default startup app to your own app and Qt Creator integration.</description>
