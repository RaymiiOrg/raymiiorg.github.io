                <description>I have a deep-seated hatred towards half-assed quick-moneygrabbing marketeers, but today they reached at an all-time low. This site is `raymii.org`, I received an email for a guest post on `dragonflydigest.com`. Not even remotely alike in spelling. I'm not called Justin, and I (sadly) don't maintain an excellent BSD distro. So dear telemarketers, every week I get emails like this, please put in a bit more effort. Normally I don't spend any time or effort, certainly not provide exposure, but this instance of Cunningham's Law does deserve a post, sadly.</description>
