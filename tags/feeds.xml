                <title>Tiny Tiny RSS vs Miniflux</title>

                <description>I'm an heavy user of RSS feeds, having over 1500 feeds I follow. Without a decent feed reader that setup wouldn't work. For over eight years now I've been an happy user of Tiny Tiny RSS, a web based feed reader. But, recently I found out about 'miniflux', also a web based RSS reader. In this article I'll compare the two for my use cases, mostly mobile usage. TD;DR, I've switched to Miniflux, due to it being more suited for mobile usage, less ajax heavy, easier to subscribe to feeds and a more pleasant reading layout.</description>

                <title>Tiny Tiny RSS + Readability == The best way to read RSS feeds</title>

                <description>Back in 2012, I already wrote about Tiny Tiny RSS. We're now almost eight years later and I still use TT-RSS as my main RSS reader. I'm following almost a thousand feeds (944) and it is my main way of reading and discovering stuff online. All those personal blogs that post once half a year, mainline tech news sites and a bunch more sites. Back in 2012 I had 300 feeds, used the Android app. Nowdays, more feeds, still use the android app, used an iPhone app for a while and the server that it runs on has been migrated and upgraded a few times. I want to share my Tiny Tiny RSS setup with you, which uses the af_readability plugin. Combined with the Android app, I've got an ideal setup to read just content without distractions. </description>
