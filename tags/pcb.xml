                <title>My First PCB: Relay AND gate</title>

                <description>This is the result of my first attempt at learning KiCad during the Christmas break. I love the sound of a relay, so trying out [these relay logic gates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nXc439NTYk) from the Usagi video and the information [here on the MERCIA relay computer](https://web.archive.org/web/20250104211313/https://relaiscomputer.nl/index.php/elements) on a breadboard was fun, but a bit messy. No transistors or modern components, just relays, push buttons, resistors and LED's to show output. I've always wanted to make my own PCB. These simple relay logic gates are perfect to try out KiCad and actual PCB design, having never done that before. This short post shows you my first PCB, with all the beginner mistakes included. </description>
