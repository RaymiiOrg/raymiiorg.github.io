                <description>In this guide I'll show you how to build a weather app for the Seeed reTerminal using Qt and QML. Imagine the reTerminal in your entrance hallway and with just a quick glance at the screen you'll know what the weather will be the next few hours, if you need an umbrella, if you'll have a headwind on your bicycle ride or if it's just going to be clear and sunny. This tutorial builds on the [reTerminal Yocto boot2qt distro](/s/tutorials/Yocto_boot2qt_for_the_Seeed_reTerminal_qt6.html) we've built in the previous article and uses Qt 6. Qt is a C++ framework, but this Weather app will use QML almost exclusively. I'm using just QML to make the guide more accessible and also because I'm used to doing everything in C++, so a sidestep to QML is fun for me as well. </description>
