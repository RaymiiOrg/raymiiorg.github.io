                <title>My First PCB: Relay AND gate</title>

                <description>This is the result of my first attempt at learning KiCad during the Christmas break. I love the sound of a relay, so trying out [these relay logic gates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nXc439NTYk) from the Usagi video and the information [here on the MERCIA relay computer](https://web.archive.org/web/20250104211313/https://relaiscomputer.nl/index.php/elements) on a breadboard was fun, but a bit messy. No transistors or modern components, just relays, push buttons, resistors and LED's to show output. I've always wanted to make my own PCB. These simple relay logic gates are perfect to try out KiCad and actual PCB design, having never done that before. This short post shows you my first PCB, with all the beginner mistakes included. </description>

                <description>The Gherkin keyboard is a 30% (actually a 30 key) keyboard kit. I've built one and used it for a while, this article covers the build and my experiences with such a small board.</description>

                <description>On Reddit, Josh (from SpaceCat) did a valentines day action, 10% off your entire order. I'm eyeing a LaunchPad for a while now, both to have a small macro pad and to experiment with QMK (firmware). So I ordered the LaunchPad full kit, an assortment of Gateron key switches and a VIM keycap. This article goes over the quality, the build process and my current setup of the Launchpad.</description>
