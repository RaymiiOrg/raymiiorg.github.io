                <title>Reset iptables to ACCEPT all (backup and remove all existing rules)</title>

                <description>Here's a small bash script that removes all iptables rules and sets up a default ACCEPT ALL state. Before the reset, it creates a backup of the current rules. I use this often to troubleshoot servers with networking issues. If you just blindly do an `iptables -F` you might lock yourself out of a server since the INPUT policy might be DROP.</description>

                <title>Get all IP ranges from an AS number</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/snippets/Get_all_IP_ranges_from_an_AS_number.html</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/snippets/Get_all_IP_ranges_from_an_AS_number.html</guid>
                <description>One of my clients wanted to block a few social networking websites. Since they have no IPv6 (yet) I figured the simplest way was to block access to the entire IP range. This won't work for all the CDN networks they use, but it does get you started. To find all the ranges beloning to an AS number you can query the whois.radb.net server with the AS number.</description>

                <title>pfSense allow web interface access on WAN from specific IP</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/snippets/pfSense_allow_web_interface_access_on_WAN_from_specific_IP.html</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/snippets/pfSense_allow_web_interface_access_on_WAN_from_specific_IP.html</guid>
                <description>pfSense is a fast and simple FreeBSD based firewall appliance with a nice web managent interface and the power of the pf firewall underneath. Normally the web interface is only accessible from the management LAN (or LAN by default) interface. If you for whatever reason locked yourself out or need access from a different IP via the WAN interface you can use the easyrule command line to temporarly add a rule that allows your remote IP in. This simple snippet shows you how.</description>

                <title>Configserver Firewall and Security (CSF and LFD)</title>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/articles/Configserver_Firewall_and_Security_CSF_LFD.html</guid>
                <description>his page covers my notes about csf and lfd. csf is an easy SPI iptables firewall suite. lfd is the login failure daemon, which scans log files for failed authentication and blocks the IP's doing that. This page covers installation, populair command line options and popular config file options.</description>
