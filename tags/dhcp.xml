                <description>Because I wanted to experiment with Kubernetes I bought a few cheap SBC's and a Power over Ethernet switch to run `k3s`. Since Kubernetes is very resource intensive I wanted to try to boot the boards via the network without causing wear on the Micro SD card. The boards have built-in SPI flash from which it can boot `u-boot` and Armbian works quite well with a root filesystem over NFS. This guide will help you with netbooting an Orange Pi Zero 3 running Armbian.</description>

                <description>When running dnsmasq under OpenVZ I sometimes get an error when restarting: set capabilities failed. This is because dnsmasq starts as root, then does privileged stuff and then drops to the configured run user. In OpenVZ these permissions are not passed to the VPS, sadly. These three commands fix the problem.</description>
