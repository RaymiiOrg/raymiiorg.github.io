                <description> Syslog is the protocol, format (and software) linux and most networking devices use to log messages. All kinds of messages, system, authentication, login and applications. There are multiple implementations of syslog, like syslog-ng and rsyslog. Syslog has the option to log to a remote server and to act as a remote logserver (that receives logs). With a remote logging server you can archive your logs and keep them secure (when a machine gets hacked, if root is compromised the logs on the machine are no longer trustworthy). This tutorial shows how to set up a syslog server with rsyslog and syslog-ng and shows how to setup servers as a syslog client (that log to a remote server) with syslog-ng and rsyslog.</description>
