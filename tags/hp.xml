                <title>That time when one of my HP-UX servers lost half of it's RAM (and how to connect to an HP iLO 2 with modern OpenSSH (7.6+))</title>

                <description>One of my favorite sayings is: 'Hardware is stupid, move everything to the cloud!'. The cloud is just someone elses computer, but at least I'm not responsible for the hardware anymore, since hardware breaks. When a VM breaks, because you use configuration management and version control, just roll out a new one. We all know that's not true, but still, the thought of it is nice. Last week one of the HP-UX machines had a failing disk and this week it's back with a whole new issue. After it was rebooted (due to issues with the services running on it), the Event Monitoring Service (EMS) sent an email regarding RAM issues and after manual checking it seems the machine lost half of it's RAM. It should have 16 GB and now it only has 8 GB. You might imagine my suprise. This post goes into my troubleshooting, since I was not able to go to the machine, shut it down and check if the RAM was still there. I'll cover the use of cstm (Support Tool Manager), how to connect to the HP iLO (out of band access) with modern OpenSSH (7.2) and the steps I took to gather information on what might have happened. </description>

                <title>HP-UX 11.31 System information and find out part number of a failed disk with sasmgr</title>

                <description>On one of my regular scheduled datacenter visits one of the older HP-UX Itanium machines had an orange light on the front. These systems are not (yet) monitored, but still in use so the disk had to be replaced. Not knowing anything about this system or which parts were used, I managed to find the exact part number and device type so we could order a spare. This small guide uses sasmgr to get the data on HP-UX 11.31.</description>
