                <description>For a small personal project that talks to a few JSON API's and does some data parsing I needed a header only C++ HTTP library. Header only because that is the simplest way to include it in my project, just copy and paste the file. I came across the project cpp-httplib, which fits my needs, does all the http methods, small, a few examples and it looks modern and has recent development commits. Setup and getting it working was easy, but as soon as I tried an https url, I got an exception ('https scheme is not supported.'). This guide shows you how to setup cpp-httplib for SSL support with cmake. It took me a bit longer than I wanted to set it up correctly, so why not save you the effort.</description>
