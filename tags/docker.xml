                <description>At work and at home my ISP's have native IPv6. I recently was at a clients location where they had no IPv6 at all and had to set up and demonstrate an application in a Docker container with IPv6 functionality. They said the had IPv6 but on location it appeared that IPv6 wasn't working. Since IPv6 was required for the demo the container needed a workaround. This article describes the workaround I used to add IPv6 to a Docker container on a non IPv6 network.</description>
