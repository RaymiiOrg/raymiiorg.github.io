                <title>Build a Flexible and Powerful System with Arch Linux</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Build_a_Flexible_and_Powerful_System_with_Arch_Linux.html</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Build_a_Flexible_and_Powerful_System_with_Arch_Linux.html</guid>
                <description>This article covers the basic installation and configuration of Arch Linux, the distro that adheres to the Keep It Simple, Stupid principle. Arch Linux is a rolling release, that means that you always have the latest and greatest software. With Arch, you're on your own. In a world where where technology is taking your personal responsibility and giving it to the cloud, or to an internet search filter or the device manufacturers, getting your hands dirty with an operating system can be a revelation. Not only will you learn a great deal about how Linux works and what holds the whole thing together, you'll get a system you understand from the inside-out, and one that can be instantly upgraded to all the latest packages. You may also learn something about yourself in the process. And despite its reputation, it's not that difficult.</description>
