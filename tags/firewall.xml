                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/nginx_1.15.2_ssl_preread_protocol_multiplex_https_and_ssh_on_the_same_port.html</guid>
                <description>The NGINX blog recently had a nice article on a new feature of NGINX 1.15.2, $ssl_preread_protocol. This allows you to multiplex HTTPS and other SSL protocols on the same port, or as their blog states, 'to distinguish between SSL/TLS and other protocols when forwarding traffic using a TCP (stream) proxy'. This can be used to run SSH and HTTPS on the same port (or any other SSL protocol next to HTTPS). By running SSH and HTTPS on the same port, one can circumvent certain firewall restrictions. If the session looks like HTTPS, nginx will handle it, if it looks like something else, it will forward it to the configured other program. I used to use SSHL to get this functionality, but now it's built into the nginx webserver. This small guide will cover the installation of the latest version of nginx on Ubuntu (16.04) and configuring this multiplex feature.</description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/blog/Reset_iptables_to_ACCEPT_all_-_backup_and_remove_all_existing_rules.html</guid>
                <description>Here's a small bash script that removes all iptables rules and sets up a default ACCEPT ALL state. Before the reset, it creates a backup of the current rules. I use this often to troubleshoot servers with networking issues. If you just blindly do an `iptables -F` you might lock yourself out of a server since the INPUT policy might be DROP.</description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/snippets/Get_all_IP_ranges_from_an_AS_number.html</guid>
                <description>One of my clients wanted to block a few social networking websites. Since they have no IPv6 (yet) I figured the simplest way was to block access to the entire IP range. This won't work for all the CDN networks they use, but it does get you started. To find all the ranges beloning to an AS number you can query the whois.radb.net server with the AS number.</description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/snippets/pfSense_allow_web_interface_access_on_WAN_from_specific_IP.html</guid>
                <description>pfSense is a fast and simple FreeBSD based firewall appliance with a nice web managent interface and the power of the pf firewall underneath. Normally the web interface is only accessible from the management LAN (or LAN by default) interface. If you for whatever reason locked yourself out or need access from a different IP via the WAN interface you can use the easyrule command line to temporarly add a rule that allows your remote IP in. This simple snippet shows you how.</description>

                <description>his page covers my notes about csf and lfd. csf is an easy SPI iptables firewall suite. lfd is the login failure daemon, which scans log files for failed authentication and blocks the IP's doing that. This page covers installation, populair command line options and popular config file options.</description>
