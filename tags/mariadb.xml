                <description> After my [first adventure with Kubernetes](/s/tutorials/My_First_Kubernetes_k3s_cluster_on_3_Orange_Pi_Zero_3s_including_k8s_dashboard_hello-node_and_failover.html), getting started with k3s on my small 3 node ARM cluster that [boots via PXE / NFS](/s/tutorials/Netboot_PXE_Armbian_on_an_Orange_Pi_Zero_3_from_SPI_with_NFS_root_filesystem.html), I noticed that there is only one k3s node that has the `control-plane,master` role. If that node fails you can no longer manager the cluster. Other nodes can fail and then the workloads (pods) will be restarted eventually after 5 minutes, but this node is special. Time to change that and make it a high available cluster.
K3s [supports](https://web.archive.org/web/20240703112841/https://docs.k3s.io/datastore/ha) high-availability with embedded `etcd` and with external databases like `MySQL` and `postgres`. `etcd` will thrash your storage (SD cards) so I decided to go with a `MySQL` cluster using `Galera` for the database and `keepalived` for the High Available Cluster IP. This guide will show you how to configure the HA database and HA-IP and I'll also setup [longhorn](https://web.archive.org/web/20240707025724/https://longhorn.io/) for high-available block storage inside kubernetes. The end result is that I can pull the power from any two of the three nodes without the k3s cluster or workloads going down. </description>

                <description>Recently I had to restore a MySQL server. The hardware had issues with the storage and required some FSCK's, disk replacements and a lot of RAID and LVM love to get working again. Which was the easy part. MySQL was a bit harder to fix. This post describes the proces I used to get MySQL working again with a recent backup. In this case it was a replicated setup so the client had no actual downtime. </description>
