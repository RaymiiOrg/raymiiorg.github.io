                <description>I'm working on a Nitrokey/SmartCard-HSM cluster article and therefore I needed three identical computers. The current version of Raspbian (2016-05-27) is based on Debian Jessie and comes with a version of OpenSC that is too old (0.14) to work with the Nitrokey/SmartCard-HSM. Since there is no Ubuntu 16.04 official image yet I decided to upgrade Raspbian to Debian Testing. Since I don't want to answer yes to any config file changes or service restarts I figured out how to do an unattended dist-upgrade.</description>
