                <description>While cleaning out my collection of electronics, I found a PDA. Not the modern kind (voice assistant), but the old school precursor to the smartphone. It's a HP iPAQ h4350, it was a model used by the Dutch Railways. I picked it up in working condition years ago and was wondering, how does a mobile device from 2003 stack up to a modern smartphone? The first thing I did was run linux on it which worked surprisingly well, it however was noticeably slower than Windows Mobile. This post shows you how well the device still works in 2022, including using WhatsApp to chat. Almost all things I use my smartphone for, I can do with this PDA!</description>
