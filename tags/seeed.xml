                <title>HTTP GET requests with Qt and in Qml (async)</title>

                <description>With Qt it's very easy to work with (async) HTTP requests. This guide shows you how to do it with Qt core and in Qml. The two examples print the output of a HTTP GET request on screen after pressing a button. The Qml method uses JavaScript, so that's cheating a bit, the other method uses plain C++ with Qt's libraries for networking (`QNetworkAccessManager`) and signals and slots for the async part.</description>

                <title>Yocto boot2qt for the Seeed reTerminal (Qt 6)</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Yocto_boot2qt_for_the_Seeed_reTerminal_qt6.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Yocto_boot2qt_for_the_Seeed_reTerminal_qt6.html</guid>
                <description>In this guide we'll build a linux distribution for Seeed reTerminal, using the Yocto project and the `boot2qt` stack provided by Qt. This `boot2qt` image can be written to the internal eMMC and when booted up, the Seeed reTerminal runs a software stack that integrates nicely with Qt Creator (the Qt IDE), for example, one click deployment to the device. You can run your own Qt application on the reTerminal, full screen, it will boot right into it.
This guide covers Qt 6.2. The guide also covers changing the default startup app to your own app, Qt Creator integration and rotating your Qt app, both Widgets and QML, the latter via Wayland and Weston.</description>

                <title>Build a WeatherTerminal app for the Seeed reTerminal (with Qt 6 &amp; QML)</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Qt_QML_WeatherTerminal_app_for_the_Seeed_reTerminal.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Qt_QML_WeatherTerminal_app_for_the_Seeed_reTerminal.html</guid>
                <description>In this guide I'll show you how to build a weather app for the Seeed reTerminal using Qt and QML. Imagine the reTerminal in your entrance hallway and with just a quick glance at the screen you'll know what the weather will be the next few hours, if you need an umbrella, if you'll have a headwind on your bicycle ride or if it's just going to be clear and sunny. This tutorial builds on the [reTerminal Yocto boot2qt distro](/s/tutorials/Yocto_boot2qt_for_the_Seeed_reTerminal_qt6.html) we've built in the previous article and uses Qt 6. Qt is a C++ framework, but this Weather app will use QML almost exclusively. I'm using just QML to make the guide more accessible and also because I'm used to doing everything in C++, so a sidestep to QML is fun for me as well. </description>
