                <description>When you create images for an OpenStack Cloud you want to use 'cloud' features. Fancy term for automatic resizing of your instance disk, adding an SSH key, (re)setting passwords and executing scripts on first boot to configure your instance further. OpenStack provides the metadata service for instances, which supplies information for the instance, like its public IP, SSH public key that was provided and vendor or user provided data like scripts or information. The OpenStack metadata service allows an instance to post data to an endpoint wich can be retreived with the 'nova get-password' command. It is meant to be an encrypted password (with the public SSH key) but it can be any plain text as well and it doesn't have to be the root password. In this guide I'll go over the scripts I use inside linux images to post a password to the metadata service and the 'nova' commands such as 'set-password' and 'get-password'. That includes decrypting a password with an SSH key that is password-protected (Horizon and nova don't support that) and the 'nova set-password' command, which sets the root password inside an instance when it has the 'qemu-guest-agent' installed and running.</description>

                <description>The OpenStack dashboard, Horizon, is a great piece of software to manage your OpenStack resources via the web. However, it has, in my opinion, a very big usability issue. The loading dialog that appears after you click a link. It blocks the entire page and all other links. So, whenever I click, I have to wait three to five seconds before I can do anything else. Clicked the wrong menu item? Sucks to be you, here have some loading. Clicked a link and quickly want to open something in a new tab while the page is still loading? Nope, not today. It's not that browsers have had a function to show that a page is loading, no, of course, the loading indication that has been there forever is not good enough. Let's re-invent the wheel and significantly impact the user experience. With two rules in uBlock Origin this loading modal is removed and you can work normally again in Horizon</description>

                <title>Burn in testing for new Hypervisor and Storage server hardware</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/blog/Burn_in_testing_for_Hypervisor_and_Storage_servers.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/blog/Burn_in_testing_for_Hypervisor_and_Storage_servers.html</guid>
                <description>This article talks over how and why to do burn in testing on hypervisor and storage servers. I work at a fairly large cloud provider, where we have a lot of hardware. Think thousands of hardware servers and multiple ten thousand harddisks. It's all technology, so stuff breaks, and at our scale, stuff breaks often. One of my pet projects for the last period has been to automate the burn-in testing for our virtualisation servers and the storage machines. We run OpenStack and use KVM for the hypervisors and a combination of different storage technology for the volume storage servers. Before they go in production, they are tested for a few days with very intensive automated usage. We've noticed that they either fail then, or not. This saves us from having to migrate customers off of new production servers just a few days after they've gone live. The testing is of course all automated.</description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/articles/Openstack_Soft_Delete_-_recover_deleted_instances.html</guid>
                <description>This article contains both an end user and OpenStack administrator guide to set up and use soft_delete with OpenStack Nova. If an instance is deleted with nova delete, it's gone right away. If soft_delete is enabled, it will be queued for deletion for a set amount of time, allowing end-users and administrators to restore the instance with the nova restore command. This can save your ass (or an end-users bottom) if the wrong instance is removed. Setup is simple, just one variable in nova.conf. There are some caveats we'll also discuss here. </description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Ansible_-_create_OpenStack_servers_with_os_server.html</guid>
                <description>I regularly deploy clusters and single servers on OpenStack with Ansible. However, Ansible 2.0 comes with new OpenStack modules my playbooks still used the old ones. I reserved some time to convert these playbooks to the new modules and ansible 2. This article shows a very simple example, it creates three servers in OpenStack and adds them to different hostgroups based on variables. For example, to create one loadbalancer and two appservers and run specific playbooks on those hosts based on their role.</description>

                <description>This guide shows you how to migrate KVM virtual machines with the  Openstack Nova compute service, either manually or with the Openstack tooling. Openstack provides a few different ways to migrate virtual machines from one compute node to another. Each option has different requirements and restrictions, for example, you can't live-migrate without shared storage. You can't live-migrate if you have a configdrive enabled. You can't select the target host if you use the nova migrate (non-live) command etc. This article describes the most common migration scenario's including live and manual migration using native linux tools.</description>

                <description>This tutorial will show you how to create a VM in Openstack and execute a script at the first boot using cloud-init's user-data feature. This way you can eliminate some more manual labor and keep a small base image, instead of requiring all kinds of specific images for specific tasks. This tutorial will also give you a few example scripts to use with cloud-init and to create Openstack virtual machines from the command line. </description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/articles/Fix_inconsistent_Openstack_volumes_and_instances_from_Cinder_and_Nova_via_the_database.html</guid>
                <description>When running Openstack, sometimes the state of a volume  or an instance can be inconsistent on the cluster. Nova might find a volume attached while Cinder says the volume is detached or otherwise. Sometimes a volume deletion hangs, or a detach does not work. If you've found and fixed the underlying issue (lvm, iscsi, ceph, nfs etc...) you need to bring the database up to date with the new consistent state. Most of the time a reset-state works, sometimes you need to manually edit the database to correct the state. These snippets show you how.</description>

                <description>This guide shows you how to use Openstack Affinity groups. Affinity or Anti-Affinity groups allow you to make sure instances (VM/VPS) are on the same hypervisor host or on a different one. There are cases when you want two instances on different compute nodes, for example, when they are clustered servers like a load balancer or a database master-master setup. All VMs in each Affinity group are hosted in the same hypervisor, while no two VMs of a same Anti-Affinity group are hosted in the same hypervisor.</description>
