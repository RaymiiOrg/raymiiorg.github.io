                <description>In C++, everything has a type. When declaring a function you specify the return type and for each parameter you specify what type it is, just as for regular variables. Templates aside (those still have a type), you almost always know what type of data you're working with. There is the 'auto' keyword, which can save you a lot of typing and duplicate code, but fundamentally you're still working with types. Since C++ 17 you can use 'std::any' to store anything, without knowing the type. This is awesome for some tasks, and horrific for most use cases. In this article I'll show an example of a 'std::map' with 'std::any', that behaves like a python 'dict', it's able to store multiple different types in the same container.</description>
