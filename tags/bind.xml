                <description>On systems that use systemd-resolved for DNS you will see the 127.0.0.53 IP address in dig output. dig is a tool to do DNS lookups, and for troubleshooting it's usefull to see which server is being queried. With systemd-resolved, you need to issue another command to view the actual server that is being queried, since systemd-resolvd also acts as a local caching server.</description>

                <description>Recently I ran into an issue with FreeIPA when trying to add an existing DNS zone. The zone already exists on the internet so, logically, FreeIPA wouldn't allow me to hijack this domain locally. My usecase is special, so I wanted to forcefully add this zone as a forward zone.</description>

                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Exchange_2007_2010_Autodiscovery_DNS_SRV_record_for_BIND.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Exchange_2007_2010_Autodiscovery_DNS_SRV_record_for_BIND.html</guid>
                <description>This is a BIND configuration example to set up Exchange Autodiscovery. Autodiscovery is the ability for Outlook to automatically configure itself to an Exchange 2007/2010 server. The main benefit is for remote users to use Outlook on the Internet as if it was connected on the LAN, this is called Outlook Anywhere or Outlook RPC over HTTP. This is very easily accomplished by having a specific DNS record available for the domain. However, the only examples Microsoft gives you are for their own software. This is the BIND version of the record.</description>

                <description>The BIND nameserver (and many others) return their version number when queried a special DNS query. This tutorial shows you how to query the BIND version and how to stop your own BIND server sending its version out.</description>
