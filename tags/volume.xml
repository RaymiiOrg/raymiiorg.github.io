                <description>When running Openstack, sometimes the state of a volume  or an instance can be inconsistent on the cluster. Nova might find a volume attached while Cinder says the volume is detached or otherwise. Sometimes a volume deletion hangs, or a detach does not work. If you've found and fixed the underlying issue (lvm, iscsi, ceph, nfs etc...) you need to bring the database up to date with the new consistent state. Most of the time a reset-state works, sometimes you need to manually edit the database to correct the state. These snippets show you how.</description>
