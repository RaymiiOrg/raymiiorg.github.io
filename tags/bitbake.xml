                <description>This is a small snippet showing a Yocto recipe that executes a script on every build of an image that includes that recipe. I use it to write the build hosts date/time to a file on the image, but you could do anything you want inside the script.
It's not recommended to do this, for example, if you want to place a binary on your image you should version it correctly. Yocto can build from a git repo, no need to copy binaries. If you include the `buildinfo` class your image or the `os-release` recipe, build info is also written to your image. </description>
