                <description>This is a static site, meaning that no server-side processing occurs. All HTML is generated out of a few folders full of markdown source and then uploaded to the cluster. Searching on this site was always provided by a text-box form that sent you to google with 'site:raymii.org' appended to it. Works fine, but it sends all data to Google. With my recent removal of all Google Ads on this site, as well as tracking via Google Analytics, sending searches via Google seems wrong. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I recently found the `pagefind` program which I now use on here, it is a self hosted static site search engine of sorts.</description>
