                <description>I've made some new improvements to this website. Raymii.org is generated using my self-written static site generator named ingsoc, the new features are focussed on accessibility. If you are using a screen reader or command-line browser this will benefit you. Or if you like to archive stuff offline. The two main improvements are a text-only version of every content page (article/tutorial etc) and a 'Skip to main content' link.</description>

                <description>I had a request from a friend to figure out how she could use her mouse via the keyboard. Normally you would use Mouse Keys, but she uses a kinesis freestyle2 keyboard which has no numpad. By using xbindkeys together with xdotool we can use our own key combination to move the mouse keys, in any window manager. </description>
