                <description>This is a response on a great article from Pascal Bourguignon, namely how to run Emacs as PID 1. As we all know, nobody uses emacs. No, all joking aside, I found it to be a good article and wanted to see how I could do that with Vim. Not in User Mode Linux, but by creating an actual ISO. Boot to Vim, as you might want to call it. This is actually fairly simple. Compile vim statically, set it as init= at boot and you're done. We are going to use small 9MB distro named Tiny Core, Core edition and customize that to boot right into our static build of Vim.</description>
