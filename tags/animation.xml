                <description>This guide shows you how to implement drag and drop in Qml including how to reorder the backing C++ (`QAbstractListModel` derived) data model.
Most QML Drag and Drop examples you find online, including the Qt official example, use a `ListModel` in the same Qml file which has the data, but no example I found actually reordered a C++ model.
This example has a simple `MVVM (model-view-viewmodel)` C++ structure and a QML file with a drag and drop grid. The dragable example items come from the C++ model, which is derived from `QAbstractListModel`.</description>
