                <description> To fill some time [during compiling](https://xkcd.com/303/) I tried to get a VNC client running on a coffee machine, specifically to show MS Teams. At work I develop software for these coffee machines in C++, which allows me to do such fun stuff, because from a software point of view, it's just an ARM PC running linux with a framebuffer for graphics. I compiled a few framebuffer VNC clients, fired up an SSH tunnel and used `x11vnc` to share one specific window and after a few attempts, Teams was up and running on my 'new' second monitor.
This post contains my little adventure in framebuffer VNC clients, but it's not a comprehensive guide as most of my other articles. Showing you how to set up an Openembedded server with a VariScite specific toolchain is way too much work to cross-compile a simple C program, but since that's my day job, why not use it for fun. It contains some tips for `x11vnc` and shows you two different framebuffer VNC clients, `fbvnc` and `directvnc`.</description>
