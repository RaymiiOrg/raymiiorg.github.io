                <description> Recently I got a new Github Sponsor, a one-time donor. Often, these github profiles list a name, email address or some information to contact the person, even a last-resort ssh key with a comment, but this profile has nothing. They joined github 8 days ago, and I suspect it was just to do a donation to me.
Because I have no other way of communicating, here is a public post to say thank you to [shotternail](http://web.archive.org/web/20220207192842/https://github.com/shotternail), whomever you are!</description>

                <title>Github Actions, C++ with Boost and cmake, almost a 50% speedup with caching</title>

                <description>For a personal project I use Github for source code hosting and Github Actions as an automated build and test tool. Github Actions compiles my cmake project and runs all the unit tests on every commit. It also saves a build artifact, the actual compiled program. By utilizing some dependency caching and make flags I sped up the build process by 43% by caching the apt install libboost1.65-dev and giving cmake a -j2 makeflag. This article shows my simple setup to compile a C++ project with cmake and Boost on Github Actions. After compilation, it runs all the tests and uploads the compiled binary for download. For my one man project it's overkill, but when collaborating or when builds take a long time on your own machine, it's great to have an automated build / test system.</description>

                <description>This article shows you how to report bugs properly and help open source projects by doing so. It explains the things that help create a good bug report, one on which the developers can actually work on. It also explains the process of bug reporting, what happens after you've did the initial report?</description>

                <description>Gitlab is a self hosted git based source control application similar to Github, written in Ruby on Rails. It is used by many organisations and is a wonderfull piece of software. It supports LDAP Authentication (via the OmniAuth Gem), but it is tricky to set up with Active Directory and Windows Server 2003/2008/2012. This tutorials shows you how to set up Gitlab to authenticate against Active Directory LDAP.</description>
