                <description>I like to tinker with old hardware. The [DEC](https://raymii.org/s/tags/dec.html) PDP-8 is my favorite [retro computer](/s/tags/pdp-8.html) and [Office 2003](/s/blog/Using_a_Windows_Mobile_2003_PDA_hp_ipaq_in_2022_including_whatsapp.html) is the best version ever released IMHO.  One of my other favorite retro devices is the HP Jornada 720. A small `handheld PC` (smaller than a netbook) running Windows CE or in my case, Linux. It has a decent keyboard, CFL backlit screen, **32 MB of RAM(!)**, a compact Flash card for storage and a stylus for the resistive touchscreen. Oh and I got a 10Mbit PCMCIA network card, but wireless cards are also still available. It might be old, released in 1999, but can do one thing your modern iPhone can't. </description>

                <title>Install NetBSD 9.2 on a DEC Alpha CPU in QEMU with X11</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/articles/NetBSD_on_QEMU_Alpha.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link>

                <description>This is a guide on installing and running NetBSD 9.2 for the DEC Alpha CPU architecture in QEMU, including a GUI (X11 via VNC). It requires you to patch and compile QEMU yourself. It was never possible, until now, to run an actual operating system easily with QEMU Alpha, so this is amazing! It is very cool that Jason Thorpe is putting in so much effort on the QEMU side, as all but one patch is upstream already. Alpha emulation has always been a niche of a niche, so seeing this improve in QEMU is wonderful. OpenVMS does not boot yet since many more things are missing on the QEMU side, but who knows what the future might bring? Maybe even Windows NT for Alpha will boot on QEMU one day?</description>

                <title>Remote desktop on NetBSD with Xnest (no VNC)</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/articles/Remote_desktop_on_NetBSD_with_Xnest_no_VNC.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link>

                <description>After I recently wrote about NetBSD on the DEC Alpha CPU in QEMU, I decided to play with NetBSD some more. One x86_64 virtual machine later, I'm starting to appreciate the beauty and simplicity. Great documentation, both online and via the manpages, low resource usage and boy oh boy does it feel fast. But, you're not here for my love letter, you want to have a remote desktop. In the earlier article, we set up VNC, both because it shows you how to install packages and because native X11 crashes. In this article, we are going to set up X11 forwarding via SSH, but with `Xnest` instead of VNC. `Xnest` allows you to have a full desktop / window manager inside a window. If you did a full install of NetBSD, then all you need is included on the system, no need to install any packages. This is an advantage if you are on an architecture that has no precompiled binary packages or if compiling from source takes too long.</description>
