                <description>Now that I'm learning Kubernetes for a few weeks, I'm finally at the point where I was 20 years ago with regular boring old tech, being able to [host multiple domains](/s/tutorials/Kubernetes_k3s_Ingress_for_different_domains_like_virtual_hosts.html), [password protection](/s/tutorials/Password_protect_web_services_in_Kubernetes_k3s_traefik_with_basic_auth.html) and [high available clusters](/s/tutorials/High_Available_k3s_kubernetes_cluster_with_keepalived_galera_and_longhorn.html). It seems we have to re-invent the wheel every time but in the end, it's just resume-driven development, the underlying stack costs more, is way more complex but for the user, nothing changes, they see the same website as always. [Not all change is progress](https://luddites.latenightlinux.com/). Enough of being a curmudgeon, time to continue with Kubernetes. In this episode of 'Remy discovers Kubernetes', I'm setting up `cert-manager`, **not with Lets Encrypt**, but with a self-signed certificate authority. I'll also show you how to set up a regular certificate, one you've for example bought somewhere. </description>

                <description>The `openssl x509` command can be used to get information from a certificate. If you supply a filename, the command will only use the topmost certificate in the file, not all certificates in the file, like in the case of a certificate chain. The `openssl s_client -connect` command can connect to a server and show all certificates served by that server. The command I'm providing in this snippet splits up all certificates found in a file or as the result of `openssl s_client` and allows `openssl x509` to loop over each one individually. </description>

                <description>Deborphan removes packages it thinks your system doesn't need anymore. It is a great tool for package cleanup and maintenance. Sometimes, after cleaning up the packages, it will find new packages that are orphaned (because you just cleaned up). This is a small script that cleans up with deborphan until there is nothing more to cleanup.</description>

                <description>When you update OpenSSL, the software that currently has the ssl libraries loaded in memory do not automatically load the updated libraries. A full system reboot resolves that problem, but sometimes that is not possible. This command shows you all the software that has loaded the libraries, allowing you to restart only those services. If you don't restart or reload after an update, the software might still be vulnerable to issues that the update fixed.</description>

                <description>This simple snippet shows you how to update the root ca certificate bundle on CentOS 5. Some websites have certificates signed by authorities not in the default bundle and those websites will not work with tools like git, curl, wget or anything else that uses https.</description>

                <description>This is a nagios plugin to check an OCSP server. You can give it a hard coded certificate or your own one. This is sent to the OCSP server and the response is then parsed to give the correct nagios result. It is targeted at administrators who have their own OCSP and need to know when it is not working.</description>

                <description>This check lets you know if a certificate matches a private key. Today I had to set up something but I kept getting ssl errors. Turns out, the certificate did not match the private key, because the private key file was damaged. This is how I found out.</description>
