                <description>I recently had to setup a Windows development environment with Qt 5.15. Qt 5.15 is still developed by the Qt company, but only released in binary form for paying customers. The [source code is released after 1 year](/s/blog/Qt_5.15_LTS_Docker_Image_for_Android_with_OpenSSL.html#toc_0).  Via the Online Installer you can only install 5.15.2 and you must login with a Qt account. This guide shows you how to install the most recent Qt 5.15 (as of writing it's 5.15.13) and Qt Creator, **without** a Qt account. We're using `vcpkg` to compile Qt and a specific offline-enabled installer for Qt Creator.</description>
