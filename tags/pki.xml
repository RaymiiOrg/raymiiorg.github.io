                <title>Self-signed Root CA in Kubernetes with k3s, cert-manager and traefik. Bonus howto on regular certificates</title>

                <description>Now that I'm learning Kubernetes for a few weeks, I'm finally at the point where I was 20 years ago with regular boring old tech, being able to [host multiple domains](/s/tutorials/Kubernetes_k3s_Ingress_for_different_domains_like_virtual_hosts.html), [password protection](/s/tutorials/Password_protect_web_services_in_Kubernetes_k3s_traefik_with_basic_auth.html) and [high available clusters](/s/tutorials/High_Available_k3s_kubernetes_cluster_with_keepalived_galera_and_longhorn.html). It seems we have to re-invent the wheel every time but in the end, it's just resume-driven development, the underlying stack costs more, is way more complex but for the user, nothing changes, they see the same website as always. [Not all change is progress](https://luddites.latenightlinux.com/). Enough of being a curmudgeon, time to continue with Kubernetes. In this episode of 'Remy discovers Kubernetes', I'm setting up `cert-manager`, **not with Lets Encrypt**, but with a self-signed certificate authority. I'll also show you how to set up a regular certificate, one you've for example bought somewhere. </description>

                <description>The `openssl x509` command can be used to get information from a certificate. If you supply a filename, the command will only use the topmost certificate in the file, not all certificates in the file, like in the case of a certificate chain. The `openssl s_client -connect` command can connect to a server and show all certificates served by that server. The command I'm providing in this snippet splits up all certificates found in a file or as the result of `openssl s_client` and allows `openssl x509` to loop over each one individually. </description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/OpenSSL_generate_self_signed_cert_with_Subject_Alternative_name_oneliner.html</guid>
                <description>This small one liner lets you generate an OpenSSL self signed certificate with both a common name and a [Subject Alternative Name (SAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name). Most guides online require you to specify a separate config file but this guide uses a bash trick [(process substitution)](https://web.archive.org/web/20221014191420/https://superuser.com/questions/1059781/what-exactly-is-in-bash-and-in-zsh) to pass such a config file to OpenSSL via the command line. If you are using OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher, there now finally is a built in command line option which I'll also cover. </description>

                <description>This guide shows you how to test a server's TLSv1.3 connection and use specific ciphersuites with the command line s_client client from the OpenSSL project. With OpenSSL 1.1.1 you can use TLSv1.3. This guide covers the installation of OpenSSL 1.1.1 on Ubuntu, testing the connection to a server  and specific ciphersuites. It also covers the big differences between TLSv1.3 and lower.</description>

                <description>These are quick and dirty notes on generating a certificate authority (CA), intermediate certificate authorities and end certificates using the OpenSSL command line tools. It includes OCSP, CRL and CA Issuer information and specific issue and expiry dates. We'll set up our own root CA. We'll use the root CA to generate an example intermediate CA. We'll use the intermediate CA to sign end user certificates.</description>

                <description>This small tutorial will show you how to use the openssl command line to encrypt and decrypt a file using a public key. We will first generate a random key, encrypt that random key against the public key of the other person and use that random key to encrypt the actual file with using symmetric encryption.</description>

                <description>Deborphan removes packages it thinks your system doesn't need anymore. It is a great tool for package cleanup and maintenance. Sometimes, after cleaning up the packages, it will find new packages that are orphaned (because you just cleaned up). This is a small script that cleans up with deborphan until there is nothing more to cleanup.</description>

                <description>This small guide will shows you how to use the OpenSSL Command Line to sign a file, and how to verify the signing of this file. You can do this to prove ownership of a key, or to prove that a file hasn't been modified since you signed it. This works both with small text files as well as huge photo's, documents or PDF files.</description>

                <description>When you update OpenSSL, the software that currently has the ssl libraries loaded in memory do not automatically load the updated libraries. A full system reboot resolves that problem, but sometimes that is not possible. This command shows you all the software that has loaded the libraries, allowing you to restart only those services. If you don't restart or reload after an update, the software might still be vulnerable to issues that the update fixed.</description>
