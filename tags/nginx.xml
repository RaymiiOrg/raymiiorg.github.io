                <description>The NGINX blog recently had a nice article on a new feature of NGINX 1.15.2, $ssl_preread_protocol. This allows you to multiplex HTTPS and other SSL protocols on the same port, or as their blog states, 'to distinguish between SSL/TLS and other protocols when forwarding traffic using a TCP (stream) proxy'. This can be used to run SSH and HTTPS on the same port (or any other SSL protocol next to HTTPS). By running SSH and HTTPS on the same port, one can circumvent certain firewall restrictions. If the session looks like HTTPS, nginx will handle it, if it looks like something else, it will forward it to the configured other program. I used to use SSHL to get this functionality, but now it's built into the nginx webserver. This small guide will cover the installation of the latest version of nginx on Ubuntu (16.04) and configuring this multiplex feature.</description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Strong_SSL_Security_On_nginx.html</guid>
                <description>This tutorial shows you how to set up strong SSL security on the nginx webserver. We do this by updating OpenSSL to the latest version to mitigate attacks like Heartbleed, disabling SSL Compression and EXPORT ciphers to mitigate attacks like FREAK, CRIME and LogJAM, disabling SSLv3 and below because of vulnerabilities in the protocol and we will set up a strong ciphersuite that enables Forward Secrecy when possible. We also enable HSTS and HPKP. This way we have a strong and future proof ssl configuration and we get an A+ on the Qually Labs SSL Test.</description>

                <description>This Ansible tutorial shows you how execute actions only if another action has changed. For example, a playbook which downloads a remote key for package signing but only executes the apt-add command if the key has changed. Or a playbook which clones a git repository and only restarts a service if the git repository has changed.</description>

                <title>Chrome 68 is depcrecating HPKP (HTTP Public Key Pinning)</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/blog/Chrome_68_is_deprecating_HPKP.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/blog/Chrome_68_is_deprecating_HPKP.html</guid>
                <description>In 2014 I published an article on HPKP, http public key pinning. It allows a site operator to send a public key in an http header, forcing the browser to only connect when that header is found. It was ment to redice the risk of a compromised certificate authority (since any CA can create a certificate for any website). Quite secure, but it was often wrongly configured, forgotten until certificates expired and there were some security issues like a false pin. Late 2017 Google announced that HPKP would be removed in Chrome 68 and that version is released now, so HPKP is no longer supported. This post goes into the reasoning behind the removal, the possible replacement (Expect-CT) and how to remove HPKP from your site.</description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/articles/Nitrokey_HSM_web_cluster.html</guid>
                <description>This article sets up a Nitrokey HSM/SmartCard-HSM web cluster and has a lot of benchmarks. This specific HSM is not a fast HSM since it's very inexpensive and targeted at secure key storage, not performance. But, what if you do want more performance? Then you scale horizontally, just add some more HSM's and a loadbalancer in front. The cluster consists of Raspberry Pi's and Nitrokey HSM's and SmartCard-HSM's, softwarewise we use Apache, `mod_nss` and haproxy. We benchmark a small HTML file and a Wordpress site, with a regular 4096 bit RSA certificate without using the HSM's, a regular 2048 bit RSA certificate without using the HSM's, a 2048 bit RSA certificate in the HSM, a 1024 bit RSA certificate in the HSM and an EC prime256v1 key in the HSM. We do these benchmarks with the `OpenSC` module and with the `sc-hsm-embedded` module to see if that makes any difference.</description>

                <description>HTTP Strict Transport Security (often abbreviated as HSTS) is a security feature that lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. This tutorial will show you how to set up HSTS in Apache2, NGINX and Lighttpd.</description>

                <description>Let's Encrypt is a new certificate authority, recognized by all major browsers. They make it a breeze to set up TLS certificates for your web server. And for free! Let's Encrypt is supported by major players like Mozilla, Akamai, Cisco, the EFF, the Internet Security Research Group and others. Let's Encrypt provides free, automatic and secure certificates so that every website can be secured with an SSL certificate. This article shows you how to setup Let's Encrypt with the DirectAdmin web control panel. The guide is generic, so it works for other controlpanels as well. For now it works with the beta, and required some linux knowledge and root access to the hosting server.</description>

                <description>Public Key Pinning means that a certificate chain must include a whitelisted public key. It ensures only whitelisted Certificate Authorities (CA) can sign certificates for `*.example.com`, and not any CA in your browser store. This article has background theory and configuration examples for Apache, Lighttpd and NGINX.</description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Ansible_-_Only_if_a_file_exists_or_does_not_exist.html</guid>
                <description>This Ansible playbook example helps you execute actions only if a file exists or does not exist. If you for example have a command you need to run to generate a certificate (or Diffie Hellman parameters for nginx) you only want to do that once. The command itself is not convergent so it will run with every ansible run. However, the command creates a file and Ansible is able to check if that file exists. If the file exists, it will not execute the action. The same goes for checking if a file does exist and only executing the action if it exists. (The action you want to do will remove that file).</description>

                <description>This tutorial shows you how to set up OCSP stapling on nginx. OCSP stapling is an enhancement to the standard OCSP protocol that delivers OCSP responses from the server with the certificate, eliminating the need for relying parties (web users) to check OCSP responses with the issuing CA. This has the effect of reducing bandwidth, improving perceived site performance, and increasing security for everyone involved in establishing the secure session.</description>

It also shows you how to set up the collectd-web frontend, an interactive gui for collectd, and has it all firewalled. What is collectd? collectd gathers statistics about the system it is running on and stores this information. Those statistics can then be used to find current performance bottlenecks (i.e. performance analysis) and predict future system load (i.e. capacity planning). Or if you just want pretty graphs of your private server and are fed up with some homegrown solution you're at the right place, too ;). A collectd server is able to receive data from collectd clients.</description>
