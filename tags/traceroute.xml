                <description>Recently I ran into an issue with FreeIPA when trying to add an existing DNS zone. The zone already exists on the internet so, logically, FreeIPA wouldn't allow me to hijack this domain locally. My usecase is special, so I wanted to forcefully add this zone as a forward zone.</description>

                <description>This little one-liner converts the output of traceroute for IPv6 to Smokeping Target output. I had only setup my smokepings for IPv4. Recently we had an issue were network config was borked and the whole IPv4 network was not announced via BGP anymore. I was at home troubleshooting, but finding nothing since I have native IPv6 and that part still worked. My Smokeping did show loss, and that explicitly uses IPv4. That helped with the debugging a lot. I have a [IPv4][4] version of this article as well.</description>
