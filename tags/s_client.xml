                <description>Now that I'm learning Kubernetes for a few weeks, I'm finally at the point where I was 20 years ago with regular boring old tech, being able to [host multiple domains](/s/tutorials/Kubernetes_k3s_Ingress_for_different_domains_like_virtual_hosts.html), [password protection](/s/tutorials/Password_protect_web_services_in_Kubernetes_k3s_traefik_with_basic_auth.html) and [high available clusters](/s/tutorials/High_Available_k3s_kubernetes_cluster_with_keepalived_galera_and_longhorn.html). It seems we have to re-invent the wheel every time but in the end, it's just resume-driven development, the underlying stack costs more, is way more complex but for the user, nothing changes, they see the same website as always. [Not all change is progress](https://luddites.latenightlinux.com/). Enough of being a curmudgeon, time to continue with Kubernetes. In this episode of 'Remy discovers Kubernetes', I'm setting up `cert-manager`, **not with Lets Encrypt**, but with a self-signed certificate authority. I'll also show you how to set up a regular certificate, one you've for example bought somewhere. </description>

                <title>OpenSSL get entire certificate chain from a domain or loop over entire chain in file</title>

                <description>The `openssl x509` command can be used to get information from a certificate. If you supply a filename, the command will only use the topmost certificate in the file, not all certificates in the file, like in the case of a certificate chain. The `openssl s_client -connect` command can connect to a server and show all certificates served by that server. The command I'm providing in this snippet splits up all certificates found in a file or as the result of `openssl s_client` and allows `openssl x509` to loop over each one individually. </description>
