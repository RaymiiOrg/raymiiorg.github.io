                <title>Firefox 89 Proton UI Tab Styling</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/blog/Firefox-89-proton-ui-tab-styling.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link>

                <description>Firefox 89 recently came out with a 'new' user interface (named proton). I'm not a fan of change because UX/UI people need to make it seem like their job is relevant. Also, the picture they show under the headline '17 billion clicks...' only scares the crap out of me, tracking every move a user makes in their browser seems to me to be a bad idea, but hey, lets see how long Mozilla can continue their war against their own users. Since the `about:config` flag to disable proton will probably be gone in a few releases I thought, why not try to get used to this new interface. It's so enormous and wide, lacking contrast. As you might have guessed, I cannot get used to the tab bar, so in this post I'll show you how to use the `userChrome.css` file to make the new tab bar look a bit more like the old tab bar. </description>

                <title>Lets talk about changelogs, or, how I loathe 'bugfixes and performance improvements'</title>

                <description>This is a short personal rant to start the new year off. When you're a multi billion dollar company with more software developers than you'd ever need, how on earth is it possible that your public changelog in an app store is just 'bugfixes and performance improvements'? If that is all you're going to put there, then just leave it blank. Or be honest and put 'We can't be arsed to fill this in' there. For me as a technical user it's not actionable, and your non technical users are not going to read that page anyway.</description>

                <description>The title of this article says enough. To change the default browser on an iOS device you need to jailbreak your device (root it). It's 2020 and Apple does not allow you to switch Safari with Firefox. Recently a new jailbreak for iOS was released which support the lastest firmware, 13.5. I currently have an iPhone SE 2020 running 13.5, the jailbreak was a welcome addition to fix some small and some big annoyances with iOS. Like switching to Firefox as default browser. This post contains both a small rant on the state of iOS as wel as links to the jailbreak and applications used to switch the default browser.</description>

                <description>Recently I discovered a firefox extension that converts any website into a dark version. Works both on firefox for mobile and on the desktop (and all other major browsers), is open source, causes less strain on the eyes and improves battery life. Just as the earlier post on Blokada, I find this such a cool piece of software I wanted to share it with all my readers.</description>

                <description>This is a small script to gather some statistics from your Firefox history. First we use sqlite3 to parse the Firefox history database and get the last three months, then we remove all the IP addresses and port numbers and finally we sort and count it.</description>
