                <description>We are going to prepare a FreeBSD image for Openstack deployment. We do this by creating a FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE instance, installing it and converting it using bsd-cloudinit. We'll use the CloudVPS public Openstack cloud for this. We'll be using the Openstack command line tools, like nova, cinder and glance. A FreeBSD image with Cloud Init will automatically resize the disk to the size of the flavor and it will add your SSH key right at boot. You can use Cloud Config to execute a script at first boott, for example, to bootstrap your system into Puppet or Ansible. If you use Ansible to manage OpenStack instances you can integrate it without manually logging in or doing anything manually.</description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/snippets/pfSense_allow_web_interface_access_on_WAN_from_specific_IP.html</guid>
                <description>pfSense is a fast and simple FreeBSD based firewall appliance with a nice web managent interface and the power of the pf firewall underneath. Normally the web interface is only accessible from the management LAN (or LAN by default) interface. If you for whatever reason locked yourself out or need access from a different IP via the WAN interface you can use the easyrule command line to temporarly add a rule that allows your remote IP in. This simple snippet shows you how.</description>

This tutorial is more a collection of notes than what you are used of me, it has less explanation and such, just right on steps to get started.</description>

                <description>Because of a [bug in  mpd][1] which is fixed in 10-STABLE I wanted to move one of my FreeBSD machines from 10.0-RELEASE to 10.0-STABLE. The process to do so is fairly simple. Basically, you check out the new source code, build the world, build the kernel, install the kernel, install the world, merge some stuff and reboot. Read on to see the entire process</description>
