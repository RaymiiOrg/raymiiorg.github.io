                <description>Did you know that http://3515693643/ is a valid link? Why? Because this is the decimal form of the binary IP address. Normally we represent IP addresses as 10.0.0.1, 4 blocks of numbers. Those numbers are actually binary octets represented in decimal, therefore they can never be more than 255. If we take the whole binary number of all blocks, and convert that to base 10, we get a result like above, which in turn is a working network address. I've written a little javascript based converter so you can try it out yourself.</description>
