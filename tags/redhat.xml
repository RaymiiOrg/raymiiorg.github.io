                <title>IPSEC VPN on Centos 7 with StrongSwan</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/IPSEC_vpn_with_CentOS_7.html</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/IPSEC_vpn_with_CentOS_7.html</guid>
                <description>This is a guide on setting up an IPSEC VPN server with CentOS 7 using StrongSwan as the IPsec server and for authentication. It has a detailed explanation with every step. We choose the IPSECP protocol stack because of recent vulnerabilities found in pptpd VPNs and because it is supported on all recent operating systems by default. More than ever, your freedom and privacy when online is under threat. Governments and ISPs want to control what you can and can't see while keeping a record of everything you do, and even the shady-looking guy lurking around your coffee shop or the airport gate can grab your bank details easier than you may think. A self hosted VPN lets you surf the web the way it was intended: anonymously and without oversight.</description>
