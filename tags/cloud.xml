                <title>The yearly backup restore test</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/blog/Yearly_Backup_Restore_test.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/blog/Yearly_Backup_Restore_test.html</guid>
                <description>In my calendar there is a yearly recurring item named 'backup restore test'. This is an article on my backup scheme and the yearly restore test, covering all aspects, such as data validation, backup scheme, time and cost involved.
I started doing personal restore tests each year around 2012, when I did them for my first job. At work back then, the restore test was monthly, for my own backups I decided that yearly was okay enough, since the backup scheme, software and provider do not change. I'm using Azure cold storage for my (locally encrypted) personal backups, since it's both cheap and supported by my local NAS.

Have you done your backup restore test recently?</description>

                <description>Are you running Linux on Microsoft Azure? Then by default anyone with access to your Azure portal can run commands as root in your VM, reset SSH keys, user passwords and SSH configuration. This article explains what the backdoor (wa-linux-agent) is, what it is meant to do, how it can be disabled and removed and what the implications are. OpenStack/QEMU also have an agent/backdoor which is covered in this article as well.</description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/OpenStack_nova_get_-_password_set_-_password_and_post_encrypted_password_to_metadata_service.html</guid>
                <description>When you create images for an OpenStack Cloud you want to use 'cloud' features. Fancy term for automatic resizing of your instance disk, adding an SSH key, (re)setting passwords and executing scripts on first boot to configure your instance further. OpenStack provides the metadata service for instances, which supplies information for the instance, like its public IP, SSH public key that was provided and vendor or user provided data like scripts or information. The OpenStack metadata service allows an instance to post data to an endpoint wich can be retreived with the 'nova get-password' command. It is meant to be an encrypted password (with the public SSH key) but it can be any plain text as well and it doesn't have to be the root password. In this guide I'll go over the scripts I use inside linux images to post a password to the metadata service and the 'nova' commands such as 'set-password' and 'get-password'. That includes decrypting a password with an SSH key that is password-protected (Horizon and nova don't support that) and the 'nova set-password' command, which sets the root password inside an instance when it has the 'qemu-guest-agent' installed and running.</description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Backup_or_Sync_OpenStack_object_store_or_other_cloud_storage_with_rclone.html</guid>
                <description>This is a guide that shows you how to make backups of an object storage service like OpenStack swift or S3. Most object store services save data on multiple servers, but deleting a file also deletes it from all servers. Tools like rsync or scp are not compatible most of the time with these services, unless there is a proxy that translates the object store protocol to something like SFTP. rclone is an rsync-like, command line tool that syncs files and directories from cloud storage services like OpenStack swift, Amazon S3, Google cloud/drive, dropbox and more. By having a local backup of the contents of your cloud object store you can restore from accidental deletion or easily migrate between cloud providers. Syncing between cloud providers is also possible. It can also help to lower the RTO (recovery time objective) and backups are just always a good thing to have and test.</description>

                <description>The OpenStack dashboard, Horizon, is a great piece of software to manage your OpenStack resources via the web. However, it has, in my opinion, a very big usability issue. The loading dialog that appears after you click a link. It blocks the entire page and all other links. So, whenever I click, I have to wait three to five seconds before I can do anything else. Clicked the wrong menu item? Sucks to be you, here have some loading. Clicked a link and quickly want to open something in a new tab while the page is still loading? Nope, not today. It's not that browsers have had a function to show that a page is loading, no, of course, the loading indication that has been there forever is not good enough. Let's re-invent the wheel and significantly impact the user experience. With two rules in uBlock Origin this loading modal is removed and you can work normally again in Horizon</description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/blog/Burn_in_testing_for_Hypervisor_and_Storage_servers.html</guid>
                <description>This article talks over how and why to do burn in testing on hypervisor and storage servers. I work at a fairly large cloud provider, where we have a lot of hardware. Think thousands of hardware servers and multiple ten thousand harddisks. It's all technology, so stuff breaks, and at our scale, stuff breaks often. One of my pet projects for the last period has been to automate the burn-in testing for our virtualisation servers and the storage machines. We run OpenStack and use KVM for the hypervisors and a combination of different storage technology for the volume storage servers. Before they go in production, they are tested for a few days with very intensive automated usage. We've noticed that they either fail then, or not. This saves us from having to migrate customers off of new production servers just a few days after they've gone live. The testing is of course all automated.</description>

                <description>This article contains both an end user and OpenStack administrator guide to set up and use soft_delete with OpenStack Nova. If an instance is deleted with nova delete, it's gone right away. If soft_delete is enabled, it will be queued for deletion for a set amount of time, allowing end-users and administrators to restore the instance with the nova restore command. This can save your ass (or an end-users bottom) if the wrong instance is removed. Setup is simple, just one variable in nova.conf. There are some caveats we'll also discuss here. </description>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/OpenStack_Quick_and_automatic_instance_snapshot_backups.html</guid>
                <description>This is a guide that shows you how to create OpenStack instance snapshots automatically, quick and easy. This allows you to create a full backup of the entire instance. This guide has a script that makes creating snapshots from an OpenStack VM automatic via cron. The script uses the `nova backup` function, therefore it also has retention and rotation of the backups. It also features an option to create a snapshot before every apt action, upgrade/install/remove. This way, you can easily restore from the snapshot when something goes wrong after an upgrade. Snapshots are very usefull to restore the entire instance to an earlier state. Do note that this is not the same as a file based backup, you can't select a few files to restore, it's all or nothing.</description>

                <description>We are going to prepare a FreeBSD image for Openstack deployment. We do this by creating a FreeBSD 11.0-RELEASE instance, installing it and converting it using bsd-cloudinit. We'll use the CloudVPS public Openstack cloud for this. We'll be using the Openstack command line tools, like nova, cinder and glance. A FreeBSD image with Cloud Init will automatically resize the disk to the size of the flavor and it will add your SSH key right at boot. You can use Cloud Config to execute a script at first boott, for example, to bootstrap your system into Puppet or Ansible. If you use Ansible to manage OpenStack instances you can integrate it without manually logging in or doing anything manually.</description>

                <description>This guide shows you how to migrate KVM virtual machines with the  Openstack Nova compute service, either manually or with the Openstack tooling. Openstack provides a few different ways to migrate virtual machines from one compute node to another. Each option has different requirements and restrictions, for example, you can't live-migrate without shared storage. You can't live-migrate if you have a configdrive enabled. You can't select the target host if you use the nova migrate (non-live) command etc. This article describes the most common migration scenario's including live and manual migration using native linux tools.</description>

                <description>When running Openstack, sometimes the state of a volume  or an instance can be inconsistent on the cluster. Nova might find a volume attached while Cinder says the volume is detached or otherwise. Sometimes a volume deletion hangs, or a detach does not work. If you've found and fixed the underlying issue (lvm, iscsi, ceph, nfs etc...) you need to bring the database up to date with the new consistent state. Most of the time a reset-state works, sometimes you need to manually edit the database to correct the state. These snippets show you how.</description>

                <description>This guide shows you how to use Openstack Affinity groups. Affinity or Anti-Affinity groups allow you to make sure instances (VM/VPS) are on the same hypervisor host or on a different one. There are cases when you want two instances on different compute nodes, for example, when they are clustered servers like a load balancer or a database master-master setup. All VMs in each Affinity group are hosted in the same hypervisor, while no two VMs of a same Anti-Affinity group are hosted in the same hypervisor.</description>

                <description>We are going to prepare a FreeBSD image for Openstack deployment. We do this by creating a FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE instance, installing it and converting it using bsd-cloudinit. We'll use the CloudVPS public Openstack cloud for this. We'll be using the Openstack command line tools, like nova, cinder and glance. This tutorial is more a collection of notes than what you are used of me, it has less explanation and such, just right on steps to get started.</description>

                <title>Openstack Swift Objectstore Access via FTP</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Openstack-Swift-Objectstore-FTP-Access.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Openstack-Swift-Objectstore-FTP-Access.html</guid>
                <description>This is a guide on accessing the Openstack Swift Object Storage system using an FTP client. Openstack Swift has a beautiful API which you can program to. However, sometimes it is handy to quickly be able to access your Swift/Objectstore data without programming around it. We will use ftp-cloudfs to do this. There is also Softlayers swftp, but that does not support Keystone Authentication (2.0). ftp-cloudfs does support this. The OS X Cyberduck FTP client also has Openstack Swift support, however that is a native implementation, not using FTP. With ftp-cloudfs we can use any ftp client, from Filezilla to midnight commander.</description>

                <title>Encrypted Duplicity Backups to Openstack Swift Objectstore</title>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Encrypted_Duplicity_Backups_to_Openstack_Swift_Objectstore.html</guid>
                <description>This is a guide on backing up your data to an Openstack Swift (Objectstore) instance using Duplicity. It provides encrypted backups using gpg so that you can safely use any public cloud storage to store them. This tutorial is for Ubuntu and CentOS and includes initial setup plus a script to automate it all. We will be using the Dutch provider CloudVPS, which is a non american company, so your data is more safe than it is with a provider that is vulnerable to the patriot act. Although your data is already encrypted with GPG, you can never be to sure. CloudVPS provides 10GB free ObjectStore, if you have VPS with them, the data is stored on at least 3 machines in 3 locations and they have a boatload of certifications.</description>

                <description>This article describes my truly secure, encrypted file synchronization service. It used EncFS and dvcs-autosync which lets me share only the encrypted data and mount that locally to get the plaintext. It works on OS X, Linux and ARM linux. This article has setup instructions for all those platforms.</description>
