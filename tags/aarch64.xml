                <description>Now that I'm learning Kubernetes for a few weeks, I'm finally at the point where I was 20 years ago with regular boring old tech, being able to [host multiple domains](/s/tutorials/Kubernetes_k3s_Ingress_for_different_domains_like_virtual_hosts.html), [password protection](/s/tutorials/Password_protect_web_services_in_Kubernetes_k3s_traefik_with_basic_auth.html) and [high available clusters](/s/tutorials/High_Available_k3s_kubernetes_cluster_with_keepalived_galera_and_longhorn.html). It seems we have to re-invent the wheel every time but in the end, it's just resume-driven development, the underlying stack costs more, is way more complex but for the user, nothing changes, they see the same website as always. [Not all change is progress](https://luddites.latenightlinux.com/). Enough of being a curmudgeon, time to continue with Kubernetes. In this episode of 'Remy discovers Kubernetes', I'm setting up `cert-manager`, **not with Lets Encrypt**, but with a self-signed certificate authority. I'll also show you how to set up a regular certificate, one you've for example bought somewhere. </description>

                <title>Using nodeSelector to deploy a Kubernetes Helm chart only on x86/amd64 nodes, not arm64</title>

                <description>My [k3s cluster](/s/tutorials/My_First_Kubernetes_k3s_cluster_on_3_Orange_Pi_Zero_3s_including_k8s_dashboard_hello-node_and_failover.html) runs on Orange Pi Zero 3 small board computers, with a 1.5 GHz Allwinner H618 Quad-Core Cortex-A53 ARM64 CPU. Nowadays most popular software has support for `aarch64` due to the popularity of boards like the Raspberry Pi and the Apple M1 series processors, but smaller projects or niche software often can only run on x86/amd64. If you write your own yaml files for deployment you can use a `nodeSelector` combined with the `kubernetes.io/arch=amd64`, but with a Helm Chart this is not that obvious. This small snippets shows you the correct syntax to force deploy a Helm Chart to only amd64 nodes in your cluster. This assumes you have a mixed cluster, I added a small virtual machine to it for testing. </description>
