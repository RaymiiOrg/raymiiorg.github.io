                <description>Recently I was debugging connection issues with a system that uses connman as it's network management software. In the log it was visible that the connection went away and came back, logged with 'operstate' $number $state. I couldn't easily find an overview of all the possible states, but since it's open source we can take a look at the code to find out. Publishing it here for future reference.</description>
