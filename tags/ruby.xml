                <title>Chef: overwrite templates in wrapper-cookbooks</title>

                <description>This article describes how to use a template in a wrapper-cookbook in Chef. The Chef Cookbook Wrapper Pattern is based upon a design convention where you customize an existing library cookbook by using a separate wrapper cookbook, which wraps the original cookbook with any related configuration changes. a library cookbook is an existing cookbook, typically an open-source contribution from a user in the Chef community, designed for server configuration purposes. A wrapper cookbook is a cookbook that wraps the original library cookbook with custom modifications or additions such as overriding a Chef attribute, changing a Chef template, converting a Chef attribute to a user-definable input, etc. To override a template by just defining it again would result in it being written two times every Chef run, which is not what we want. Using this method, you can override the template from the default cookbook with a template in your wrapper-cookbook. It has an example for the graphite cookbook, where the wrapper ads LDAP login to the Apache server.</description>

                <description>This article describes a situation I had at one of my clients with Chef and the steps took to resolve this problem. They have a cookbook which builds a postgresql database node and it installs the pg ruby gem. However, it uses the chef_gem resource to do that, and it keeps failing.</description>

                <title>Chef: search in recipe based on roles or recipes</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Chef_search_in_recipe_on_roles_or_recipes.html</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Chef_search_in_recipe_on_roles_or_recipes.html</guid>
                <description>Chef supports a very powerfull search syntax which allows you for example to search all nodes with the graphite-server role and get their IP addresses. This tutorial shows you how to search based on a role a node has or a recipe a node has, plus an example config file with erb syntax. It has an example cookbook which sets up collectd as client and graphite as server. It shows you how to use the search function of Chef to get the IP addresses of the graphite servers and place those in the collectd config files. This technique is applicable to all kinds of services that use a client-server model, for example, munin, haproxy, zabbix and many more.</description>

                <title>Chef: include_recipe only_if or not_if</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Chef_include_recipe_only_if_not_if.html</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Chef_include_recipe_only_if_not_if.html</guid>
                <description>Chef supports including other recipes in cookbooks, for example, I can include the MySQL recipe from a PHP recipe. However, this is not a normal resource but a normal method. Therefore it ignores anything passed to it, including only_if or not_if. This tutorial shows you how to include or not include a recipe based on a variable, comparable with not_if or only_if.</description>

                <description>This is an overview of all the servers in the Sparkling Network, mostly as an overview for myself, but it might be interesting for others. It also has a status overview of the nodes...</description>
