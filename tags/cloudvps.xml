                <description>I regularly deploy clusters and single servers on OpenStack with Ansible. However, Ansible 2.0 comes with new OpenStack modules my playbooks still used the old ones. I reserved some time to convert these playbooks to the new modules and ansible 2. This article shows a very simple example, it creates three servers in OpenStack and adds them to different hostgroups based on variables. For example, to create one loadbalancer and two appservers and run specific playbooks on those hosts based on their role.</description>
