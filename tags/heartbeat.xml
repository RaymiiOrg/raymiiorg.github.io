                <title>Adding IPv6 to a keepalived and haproxy cluster</title>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/articles/Adding_IPv6_to_a_keepalived_and_haproxy_cluster.html</guid>
                <description>At work I regularly build high-available clusters for customers, where the setup is distributed over multiple datacenters with failover software. If one component fails, the service doesn't experience issues or downtime due to the failure. Recently I was tasked with expanding a cluster setup to be also reachable via IPv6. This article goes over the settings and configuration required for haproxy and keepalived for IPv6. The internal cluster will only be IPv4, the loadbalancer terminates HTTP and HTTPS connections. </description>

                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Keepalived_notify_script_execute_action_on_failover.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link>

                <description>Keepalived supports running scripts on VRRP state change. This can come in handy when you need to execute an action when a failover occurs. In my case, I have a VPN running on a Virtual IP and want to make sure the VPN only runs on the node with the Virtual IP.</description>

                <title>Simple keepalived failover setup on Ubuntu 14.04</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Keepalived-Simple-IP-failover-on-Ubuntu.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Keepalived-Simple-IP-failover-on-Ubuntu.html</guid>
                <description>We are going to set up very simple keepalived IP failover on Ubuntu 14.04. Keepalived is a piece of software which can be used to achieve high availability by assigning two or more nodes a virtual IP and monitoring those nodes, failing over when one goes down.  Keepalived can do more, like load balancing and monitoring, but this tutorial focusses on a very simple setup, just IP failover.</description>

                <description>With Corosync/Pacemaker there is no easy way to simply run a script on failover. There are good reasons for this, but sometimes you want to do something simple. This tutorial describes how to change the Dummy OCF resource to execute a script on failover.</description>
