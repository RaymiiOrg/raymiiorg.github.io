                <title>Chef: overwrite templates in wrapper-cookbooks</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/articles/Chef_-_overwrite_templates_in_wrapper_cookbooks.html</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/articles/Chef_-_overwrite_templates_in_wrapper_cookbooks.html</guid>
                <description>This article describes how to use a template in a wrapper-cookbook in Chef. The Chef Cookbook Wrapper Pattern is based upon a design convention where you customize an existing library cookbook by using a separate wrapper cookbook, which wraps the original cookbook with any related configuration changes. a library cookbook is an existing cookbook, typically an open-source contribution from a user in the Chef community, designed for server configuration purposes. A wrapper cookbook is a cookbook that wraps the original library cookbook with custom modifications or additions such as overriding a Chef attribute, changing a Chef template, converting a Chef attribute to a user-definable input, etc. To override a template by just defining it again would result in it being written two times every Chef run, which is not what we want. Using this method, you can override the template from the default cookbook with a template in your wrapper-cookbook. It has an example for the graphite cookbook, where the wrapper ads LDAP login to the Apache server.</description>

                <title>Microsoft Exchange / Active Directory Powershell script to notify users of expiring Passwords</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/software/Microsoft_Exchange_Powershell_Script_User_Password_Expiry.html</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/software/Microsoft_Exchange_Powershell_Script_User_Password_Expiry.html</guid>
                <description>This is a small PowerShell script which emails your users that their password is going to expire in X days. This is needed when you have an Active Directory and Exchange Environment, but your users do not log in to a Windows machine bound to the Active Directory, but for example a Mac OS X or Linux machine with Full Disk Encryption enabled. Then they are not notified that their password is about to expire. This script can run as a scheduled task and scan and email your users that their password is about to expire.</description>

                <description>This tutorial shows you how to set up a SAMBA server which authenticates all users to an Active Directory, including group based permissions.
