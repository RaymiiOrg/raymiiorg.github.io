                <title>Qt/QML setContextProperty is a bad way to expose C++ classes to QML, use these better alternatives!</title>

                <description>In this article I'm going to discuss the different ways to expose a C++ class to QML.  QML is a markup language (part of the QT framework) like HTML/CSS, with inline JavaScript that can interact with the C++ code of your (QT) application. There are multiple ways to expose a C++ class to QML, each with their own benefits and quirks. This guide will cover three integration methods, `qmlRegisterSingletonType&lt;&gt;`, `rootContext-&gt;setContextProperty()` and `qmlRegisterType&lt;&gt;`. We'll end off with a simple benchmark showing the difference in startup times between the first two. </description>

                <title>Rectangle{} debugging in QML, just like printf(), but for QT</title>

                <description>Recently I've been using a debugging technique in QT/QML that I've decided to name `Rectangle{}` debugging, in the same vein as `printf()` debugging. QML is a markup language (part of the QT framework) like HTML/CSS, with inline Javascript that can interact with the C++ code of your (QT) application. QML has the concept of `anchors` for relative positioning of elements. Overall, `anchors` work quite well, but can get complex when inheretance and complicated layouts come into play. The `Rectangle{}` style of debugging places a semi-transparent rectangle with a border around your element so you can visualize the positioning and see what effect your changes have. This article shows an example where I recently applied this style of debugging at work in our coffee machine user interface, including some tips to do actual `printf()` style debugging (but with `Console.log`).</description>

                <title>Only zero is false, everything else is true in C++</title>

                <description>When using numbers in a boolean (implicit conversion), remember that only zero evaluates to false. Anything else, including negative numbers, will evaluate to true. This snippet talks about the rules for implicit conversion in C++ when using booleans. For seasoned programmers it's nothing new, but I found it interesting.</description>
