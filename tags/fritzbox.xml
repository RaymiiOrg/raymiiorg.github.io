                <description>Recently I was gifted a T65 rotary telephone. This was **the** standard telephone in The Netherlands in the seventies and eighties. I remember my parents having one as well. Because this phone does not use DTMF but  pulse dialing it does not work with modern equipment, like the built in telephony / voip server on my FritzBox router. Using a hardware converter it is possible to convert pulse dialing to DTMF and to use your rotary phone again. This page covers two such devices, the DialGizmo and the GrandStream HT502 and a more homebrew approach.</description>
