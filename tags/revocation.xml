                <description>This guide shows you how to test a server's TLSv1.3 connection and use specific ciphersuites with the command line s_client client from the OpenSSL project. With OpenSSL 1.1.1 you can use TLSv1.3. This guide covers the installation of OpenSSL 1.1.1 on Ubuntu, testing the connection to a server  and specific ciphersuites. It also covers the big differences between TLSv1.3 and lower.</description>

                <description>These are quick and dirty notes on generating a certificate authority (CA), intermediate certificate authorities and end certificates using the OpenSSL command line tools. It includes OCSP, CRL and CA Issuer information and specific issue and expiry dates. We'll set up our own root CA. We'll use the root CA to generate an example intermediate CA. We'll use the intermediate CA to sign end user certificates.</description>

                <title>OCSP Stapling on Apache</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/OCSP_Stapling_on_Apache2.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/OCSP_Stapling_on_Apache2.html</guid>
                <description>This tutorial shows you how to set up OCSP stapling on Apache. OCSP stapling is an enhancement to the standard OCSP protocol that delivers OCSP responses from the server with the certificate, eliminating the need for relying parties (web users) to check OCSP responses with the issuing CA. This has the effect of reducing bandwidth, improving perceived site performance, and increasing security for everyone involved in establishing the secure session.</description>
