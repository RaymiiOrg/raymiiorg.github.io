                <title>Installing PyGopherd on Ubuntu 20.04</title>

                <description>Ubuntu 20.04 dropped the Pygopherd package. There is no way to install it from the official repositories. In this guide I'll show you two ways to install the version from Ubuntu 18.04, which still works perfectly on 20.04. Either via just downloading the 2 deb packages, or via `apt pinning` from the previous (18.04) repository.</description>

                <title>totext.py - Convert URL or RSS feed to text with readability</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/software/totext.py-Convert_URL_or_RSS_feed_to_plaintext_with_readability.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/software/totext.py-Convert_URL_or_RSS_feed_to_plaintext_with_readability.html</guid>
                <description> Love plaintext? This script downloads an URL, parses it with readability and returns the plaintext (as markdown). It supports RSS feeds (will convert every article in the feed) and saves every article. My usecase is twofold. One is to convert RSS feeds to a gopher site, the second is to get full text in my RSS reader. The script contains a few workarounds for so-called cookiewalls. It also pauses between RSS feed articles to not do excessive requests. The readability part is handled by Python, no external services are used.</description>

                <description>Simple log analyzer for pygopherd. Fun if you have a gopherhole and want statistics. If you ever used Logwatch you'll feel at home.</description>
