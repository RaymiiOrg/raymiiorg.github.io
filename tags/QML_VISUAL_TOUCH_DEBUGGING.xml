                <description>This guide shows you how to enable a red visual square around your `Mouseareas` and `MultiPointTouchArea` controls. It visualizes where you can click/touch and also shows any overlapping touch area's. It's helpful on full screen device interfaces like a coffee-machine or other HMI.
The environment flag `QML_VISUAL_TOUCH_DEBUGGING` needs to be set, but this is not documented on the Qt Docs site, only on a cheat sheet from 2016 by ISC. If you google for the environment flag, the only pages you get are the Qt source code and that cheat sheet. I've found this flag to be very useful when debugging touch issues, like overlapping touch or when a touch area is too small to use.
One of my co-workers found it when we had touch issues and since there is a lack of documentation, perfect for a small guide.</description>
