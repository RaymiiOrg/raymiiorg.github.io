                <description>I recently found a Navman Bike 1000 in a thrift store for EUR 10. This is a bike computer, a navigation device for cyclists, made by MiTaC, the same company that makes the Mio bike computers. This Navman Bike 1000 is a rebadged `Mio Cyclo 200`. It's from 2015 and as you might have guessed, no more map updates.
This article shows how I dabbled a bit in reverse engineering, figuring out the device runs Windows CE 6.0 and using Total Commander and [NaVeGIS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/navegis/) together with Open Street Map to get up to date maps from the OpenFietsMap project, allowing me to use this device for navigation with the most up to date maps. Since it is all open source, even if the current map provider would stop, I can always make my own maps.</description>
