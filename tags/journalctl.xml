                <description>This is a small tip I want to give you when using a `less` based pager, for example in `journalctl` or when viewing a file interactively with `less` or `more`. You can exclude certain lines that match one or multiple words (or a regex) with a few keystrokes, once `less` is open. This is one of those tips you never knew you needed, but when you know it, you'll use it frequently. Like in my case today when searching through some logfiles to find out why my database stopped working.</description>
