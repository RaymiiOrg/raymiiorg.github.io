                <description>This article shows you how I built a real world object in OpenSCAD and how I got it 3D printed. OpenSCAD is a Solid 3D modeling based on the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library. It is not like Blender, AutoCAD or Maya, who allow you to visually create and manipulate something. OpenSCAD allows you to program the entire thing. Want a cube? Type cube([10,10,10]) and you have a cube. I have no previous experience in 3D modeling or OpenSCAD, however, in about three hours I had my key ready made.</description>
