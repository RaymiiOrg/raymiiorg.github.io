                <description>Keepalived supports running scripts on VRRP state change. This can come in handy when you need to execute an action when a failover occurs. In my case, I have a VPN running on a Virtual IP and want to make sure the VPN only runs on the node with the Virtual IP.</description>

                <description>We are going to set up very simple keepalived IP failover on Ubuntu 14.04. Keepalived is a piece of software which can be used to achieve high availability by assigning two or more nodes a virtual IP and monitoring those nodes, failing over when one goes down.  Keepalived can do more, like load balancing and monitoring, but this tutorial focusses on a very simple setup, just IP failover.</description>

                <title>Corosync Pacemaker - Execute script on failover</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Corosync_Pacemaker_-_Execute_a_script_on_failover.html</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Corosync_Pacemaker_-_Execute_a_script_on_failover.html</guid>
                <description>With Corosync/Pacemaker there is no easy way to simply run a script on failover. There are good reasons for this, but sometimes you want to do something simple. This tutorial describes how to change the Dummy OCF resource to execute a script on failover.</description>
