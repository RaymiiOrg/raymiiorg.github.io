                <description>This is a guide that shows you how to make backups of an object storage service like OpenStack swift or S3. Most object store services save data on multiple servers, but deleting a file also deletes it from all servers. Tools like rsync or scp are not compatible most of the time with these services, unless there is a proxy that translates the object store protocol to something like SFTP. rclone is an rsync-like, command line tool that syncs files and directories from cloud storage services like OpenStack swift, Amazon S3, Google cloud/drive, dropbox and more. By having a local backup of the contents of your cloud object store you can restore from accidental deletion or easily migrate between cloud providers. Syncing between cloud providers is also possible. It can also help to lower the RTO (recovery time objective) and backups are just always a good thing to have and test.</description>
