                <description> Recently I got a new Github Sponsor, a one-time donor. Often, these github profiles list a name, email address or some information to contact the person, even a last-resort ssh key with a comment, but this profile has nothing. They joined github 8 days ago, and I suspect it was just to do a donation to me.
Because I have no other way of communicating, here is a public post to say thank you to [shotternail](http://web.archive.org/web/20220207192842/https://github.com/shotternail), whomever you are!</description>
