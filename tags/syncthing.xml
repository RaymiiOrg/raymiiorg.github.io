Join me on a deep dive into certificate validation and troubleshooting `apt`, digging into the C++ source code for `apt` and `GnuTLS` and in the end, it turned out to be my own fault due to permission on a folder. However, the error messages were totally unhelpful resolving the mysterious validation problem. This article was written over the period of a few days, chronologically during troubleshooting.</description>
