                <title>A way to run Ansible 2.19 on old operating systems like Ubuntu 18.04 with working Apt</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/blog/Ansible_2.19_on_old_ubuntu_18.04_with_working_apt.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link>

                <description>Ansible recently stopped working on one of my older servers. The playbooks wouldn't execute anymore, with a cryptic python error. With Ansible 2.14 this server worked, after upgrading to 2.19 the playbooks failed.
It turned out that the Python version on the server was too old. This server runs Ubuntu 18.04, that ships with Python 3.6. That server still gets updates via Canonicals Ubuntu Pro program, but no more major python version upgrades.
I manually installed Python 3.12, after which the Ansible playbook started working again, only failing to do stuff via `apt`. For example the `package`, `apt_key` and `apt_repository` modules. I've found a workaround for package installation by using ansible's `raw` commands.
This post shows how to manually install newer Python and the trick I'm using to (idompotently) get package installation working again with a few `when` rules.</description>

                <title>After 47 years, OpenVMS gets a package manager (VSP)!</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/blog/After_47_years_OpenVMS_gets_a_package_manager_VSP.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link>

                <description>As of the 18th of February, OpenVMS, known for its stability and high-availability, 47 years old and ported to 4 different CPU architecture, has a package manager!
This article shows you how to use the package manager and talks about a few of its quirks. It's an early beta version, and you do notice that when using it.
A small list of things I noticed, coming from a Linux (apt/yum/dnf) background:
There seems to be no automatic dependency resolution and the dependencies it does list are incomplete. No update management yet, no removal of packages and no support for your own package repository, only the VSI official one. Service startup or login script changes are not done automatically. Packages with multiple installer files fail and require manual intervention.
It does correctly identify the architectures, has search support and makes it way easier to install software.
The time saved by downloading, manually copying and starting installation is huge, so even this early beta is a very welcome addition to OpenVMS.</description>

                <title>Building opkg .ipk packages by hand (for OpenEmbedded/Yocto/OpenWRT)</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Building_IPK_packages_by_hand.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Building_IPK_packages_by_hand.html</guid>
                <description>.ipk packages are used by a variety of embedded linux systems, like routers running OpenWRT and appliances running on OpenEmbedded (Yocto). The opkg command installs these packages and OpenEmbedded comes with a set of tools to build .ipk packages. Recently I had to create ipk packages in a scripted fashion for a few hundred systems, all unique per system. The .ipk packages includes a few software changes for debugging, a systemd service and one precompiled binary. The yocto build tools were not available on the machine where these packages would be made so I had to figure out how to make them by hand, which means, automatically. The packages are actually just compressed files containing a few control files and the data to be extracted on the filesystem. This article will walk you through the steps of creating these packages by hand.</description>

                <title>Ansible - Only do action if on specific distribution (Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS or RHEL) or distribution version (ubuntu precise, ubuntu trusty)</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Ansible_-_Only_if_on_specific_distribution_or_distribution_version.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Ansible_-_Only_if_on_specific_distribution_or_distribution_version.html</guid>
                <description>This ansible playbook example helps you execute actions only if you are on a certain distribution. You might have a mixed environment with CentOS and Debian, when using ansible to execute actions on different servers you don't need to run yum on debian, or apt on CentOS. Some package names are different and such, so this helps you with a when statement to select a specific distribution. As a bonus, you also get a when for specific distribution versions, like Ubuntu precise (12.04 LTS) or Ubuntu trusty (14.04 LTS).</description>

                <title>Ansible - Only do something if another action changed</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Ansible_-_Only-do-something-if-another-action-changed.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link> 
                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Ansible_-_Only-do-something-if-another-action-changed.html</guid>
                <description>This Ansible tutorial shows you how execute actions only if another action has changed. For example, a playbook which downloads a remote key for package signing but only executes the apt-add command if the key has changed. Or a playbook which clones a git repository and only restarts a service if the git repository has changed.</description>

                <description>This is a guide that shows you how to add an apt repository to Debian and Ubuntu using Ansible. It includes both the old way, when the apt modules only worked on Ubuntu, and the new way, now that the apt-modules also support Debian, plus some other tricks.</description>
