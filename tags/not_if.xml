                <title>Chef: include_recipe only_if or not_if</title>

                <description>Chef supports including other recipes in cookbooks, for example, I can include the MySQL recipe from a PHP recipe. However, this is not a normal resource but a normal method. Therefore it ignores anything passed to it, including only_if or not_if. This tutorial shows you how to include or not include a recipe based on a variable, comparable with not_if or only_if.</description>
