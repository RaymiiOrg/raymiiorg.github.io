                <description>With Qt it's very easy to work with (async) HTTP requests. This guide shows you how to do it with Qt core and in Qml. The two examples print the output of a HTTP GET request on screen after pressing a button. The Qml method uses JavaScript, so that's cheating a bit, the other method uses plain C++ with Qt's libraries for networking (`QNetworkAccessManager`) and signals and slots for the async part.</description>

                <description>Recently I had to write a few monitoring plugins, one of which was a count of incoming connections to a specific network port. In the past I would have used netstat and a combination of grep and wc filter out only specific ports and established connections, but nowdays netstat is replaced by ss on ubuntu. ss has options to filter directly on all sorts of stuff, like state, ports, protocol, making the command I use more readable and use less pipes.</description>
