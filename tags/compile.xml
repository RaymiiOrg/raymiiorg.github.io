                <description>The AUR is a nice feature from Arch Linux, it allows anyone to create and upload a simple package build script, PKGBUILD, for a piece of software which is not in the repositories. Sometimes however, the PKGBUILD is outdated. You then need to manually fix it, by changing the download link or version. With a new version you get new checksums, and the makepkg command has a neat feature which generates the checksums for you.</description>

                <title>Boot to Vim, Vim as Pid 1</title>

                <guid>https://raymii.org/s/blog/Vim_as_PID_1_Boot_to_Vim.html</guid>
                <description>This is a response on a great article from Pascal Bourguignon, namely how to run Emacs as PID 1. As we all know, nobody uses emacs. No, all joking aside, I found it to be a good article and wanted to see how I could do that with Vim. Not in User Mode Linux, but by creating an actual ISO. Boot to Vim, as you might want to call it. This is actually fairly simple. Compile vim statically, set it as init= at boot and you're done. We are going to use small 9MB distro named Tiny Core, Core edition and customize that to boot right into our static build of Vim.</description>

                <description>Sometimes I need to manage a few systems with either low resources or a very restricted set of packages. On those systems no compilers or development libraries are available, however it is allowed to bring binaries.A few of those systems are 32 bit x68 systems, some are MIPS systems, even worse. They serve a secure purpose, I cannot go in to much detail about them, except for they require a high level of security, they process certificates. I really like vim as my editor, the only editor available by default on those systems is ed. I have an ed cheatsheet for this purpose. The solution for this problem is to create a statically (cross) compiled version of vim. This article shows you how to create a statically compiled vim that runs everywhere.</description>
