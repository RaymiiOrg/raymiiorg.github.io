                <description>This is a short personal rant to start the new year off. When you're a multi billion dollar company with more software developers than you'd ever need, how on earth is it possible that your public changelog in an app store is just 'bugfixes and performance improvements'? If that is all you're going to put there, then just leave it blank. Or be honest and put 'We can't be arsed to fill this in' there. For me as a technical user it's not actionable, and your non technical users are not going to read that page anyway.</description>
