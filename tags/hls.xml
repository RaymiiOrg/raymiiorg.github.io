                <description>Due to all the working-from-home in the past few months I had to setup a live stream. At first the stream went directly to YouTube, but after they've screwed up multiple times, we decided to not be dependent on them. Using restreamer, a piece of open source software to live stream both to your own server and to another (YouTube) at the same time, we have more control over the stream and are not surprised by YouTube doing stupid stuff unannounced. Restreamer provides a simple web player that works on all major platforms and streams to YouTube, but one thing it lacks is a live viewer count. That's a hard problem to solve correctly and accurately, in this article I'll show you how to do it semi-accurately via multiple ways, including live graphs. This article contains a rant on YouTube breaking stuff and the commands used to get a live viewer count. </description>
