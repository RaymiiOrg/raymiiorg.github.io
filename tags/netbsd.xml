                <title>Install NetBSD 9.2 on a DEC Alpha CPU with AXPBox</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/articles/NetBSD_Alpha_AXPbox.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link>

                <description>This is a guide on installing and running NetBSD 9.2 for the DEC Alpha CPU architecture on AXPbox, the open source Alpha Emulator. I recently wrote an article on how to install NetBSD in QEMU for Alpha and since I'm involved with the AXPbox project this article was just a matter of time. This guide shows you how to compile AXPbox and install NetBSD 9.2. It also shows you how to install packages without networking available and includes `openssl` and `sysbench` benchmarks, which we compare to NetBSD running inside QEMU.</description>

                <description>This is a guide on installing and running NetBSD 9.2 for the DEC Alpha CPU architecture in QEMU, including a GUI (X11 via VNC). It requires you to patch and compile QEMU yourself. It was never possible, until now, to run an actual operating system easily with QEMU Alpha, so this is amazing! It is very cool that Jason Thorpe is putting in so much effort on the QEMU side, as all but one patch is upstream already. Alpha emulation has always been a niche of a niche, so seeing this improve in QEMU is wonderful. OpenVMS does not boot yet since many more things are missing on the QEMU side, but who knows what the future might bring? Maybe even Windows NT for Alpha will boot on QEMU one day?</description>

                <title>Remote desktop on NetBSD with Xnest (no VNC)</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/articles/Remote_desktop_on_NetBSD_with_Xnest_no_VNC.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link>

                <description>After I recently wrote about NetBSD on the DEC Alpha CPU in QEMU, I decided to play with NetBSD some more. One x86_64 virtual machine later, I'm starting to appreciate the beauty and simplicity. Great documentation, both online and via the manpages, low resource usage and boy oh boy does it feel fast. But, you're not here for my love letter, you want to have a remote desktop. In the earlier article, we set up VNC, both because it shows you how to install packages and because native X11 crashes. In this article, we are going to set up X11 forwarding via SSH, but with `Xnest` instead of VNC. `Xnest` allows you to have a full desktop / window manager inside a window. If you did a full install of NetBSD, then all you need is included on the system, no need to install any packages. This is an advantage if you are on an architecture that has no precompiled binary packages or if compiling from source takes too long.</description>
