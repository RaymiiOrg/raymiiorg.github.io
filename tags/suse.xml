                <description> Syslog is the protocol, format (and software) linux and most networking devices use to log messages. All kinds of messages, system, authentication, login and applications. There are multiple implementations of syslog, like syslog-ng and rsyslog. Syslog has the option to log to a remote server and to act as a remote logserver (that receives logs). With a remote logging server you can archive your logs and keep them secure (when a machine gets hacked, if root is compromised the logs on the machine are no longer trustworthy). This tutorial shows how to set up a syslog server with rsyslog and syslog-ng and shows how to setup servers as a syslog client (that log to a remote server) with syslog-ng and rsyslog.</description>

                <description>This tutorial shows you how to install extra software in the VMWare vCenter appliance (VCSA). VMWare provides a vCenter appliance, which is a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server appliance with the VMWare vCenter server software installed. Because this is SUSE, we can add repositories and install software from there. By default it comes without repositories enabled. I needed to do this because I want to use NRPE on the vCenter appliance.</description>
