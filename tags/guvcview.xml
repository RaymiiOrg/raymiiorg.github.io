                <description>With all the video calling nowdays due to working from home I decided to get a webcam. Since I mostly work at a workstation, I have no microphone or camera built in. A friend gave me a spare webcam, a generic non-brand. It says 'HD Camera' on the box, but by default it records in 640x480. Using a few tools on Ubuntu you can figure out what resolutions are supported for your device. It turned out to be Cheese, the webcam capture program I used, not supporting the 'mjpeg' format, just the 'yuyv' RAW format. Using another webcam program named Webcamoid solved it, that program was able to use mjpeg.</description>
