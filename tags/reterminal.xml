                <description>In this guide we'll build a linux distribution for Seeed reTerminal, using the Yocto project and the `boot2qt` stack provided by Qt. This `boot2qt` image can be written to the internal eMMC and when booted up, the Seeed reTerminal runs a software stack that integrates nicely with Qt Creator (the Qt IDE), for example, one click deployment to the device. You can run your own Qt application on the reTerminal, full screen, it will boot right into it.
This guide covers Qt 6.2. The guide also covers changing the default startup app to your own app, Qt Creator integration and rotating your Qt app, both Widgets and QML, the latter via Wayland and Weston.</description>
