                <description>I had a request from a friend to figure out how she could use her mouse via the keyboard. Normally you would use Mouse Keys, but she uses a kinesis freestyle2 keyboard which has no numpad. By using xbindkeys together with xdotool we can use our own key combination to move the mouse keys, in any window manager. </description>
