                <description>I'm using the Headlamp dashboard for my [high-available local kubernetes cluster](/s/tutorials/High_Available_k3s_kubernetes_cluster_with_keepalived_galera_and_longhorn.html) because I find that to be faster, more clear and useful than the full blown Kubernetes Dashboard. In [my first article](/s/tutorials/My_First_Kubernetes_k3s_cluster_on_3_Orange_Pi_Zero_3s_including_k8s_dashboard_hello-node_and_failover.html#toc_4) I accessed the dashboard via a local port forward.
This article documents how to expose the dashboard via an `Ingress` and some `Traefik` specific `annotations`. The dashboard helm chart sets up HTTPS internally, `Traefik` does not like that by default. Most of the time, all internal cluster communication is insecure (I'm not sure why, seems to be a bad idea).
A few of the guides online suggest disabling HTTPS for the dashboard internally or, for the k3s specific case, disabling HTTPS validation entirely. Both of those are too broad for my use case, so I decided to figure out how to make `Traefik` talk to the `kubernetes-dashboard-kong-proxy` via `https`, without disabling certificate validation.</description>
