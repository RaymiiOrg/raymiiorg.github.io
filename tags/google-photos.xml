                <description>'Google Photos' no longer syncs with 'Google Drive' or with their 'Backup and Sync' desktop software. There used to be a checkbox to get your 'Google Photos' pictures in 'Google Drive' but that has been disabled. I used that feature together with their 'Backup and Sync' tool to sync all the photos in 'Google Photos' to my local Windows computer. From there I use 'DigiKam'  to manage the photos and backup them offline and offsite. Due to Google removing that feature, I had to go find another way to get the pictures out of 'Google Photos', which, after a few months of (automated) use, 'gphotos-sync' on Ubuntu seems to be the best, stable choice. In this guide I'll show you how to setup incremental backups from 'Google Photos' on Ubuntu. My 'DigiKam' database moved over without problems, and now I'm glad I don't have to use Windows for picture managemant anymore.</description>
