                <description>The [Atgames Legends Pinball Micro](https://web.archive.org/web/20240123213954/https://www.atgames.us/products/legends-pinball-micro) is a small virtual pinball cabinet for around USD 350. I imported one to the Netherlands, Atgames does not ship here. The built in tables are okay and more are for sale via Atgames' webshop. Overall for the price it is a nice device. Build quality is okay, software lacks a bit of quality. One really annoying issue which severely impacts gameplay is a buzz / hiss sound. This post goes over my attempts to fix this hiss and the one that worked was a ground loop isolator.</description>
