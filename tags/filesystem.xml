                <description>Spinrite is a hard drive recovery and maintenande utility written by Steve Gibson from GRC. It is marketed on the Security Now TWiT podcast which I often listen to. I have bought a copy of it and sometimes use it on solid state disks or SD cards. Spinrite 6.0 is written is assembly language and runs on top of MS-DOS or FreeDOS, using the BIOS. UEFI is not supported and neither are NVMe drives. This post will show you how to run Spinrite 6.0 on such a system anyway, using a modern linux live USB drive that can boot on UEFI only system and Virtualbox, exposing the NVMe disk as a SATA drive.</description>

                <description>The QR-Code-Generator library by Project Nayuki for C++ gives you an easy, fast and correct way to generate QR codes. However, you get just a data structure, showing that data is up to you. An example is provided to print the code to a terminal, but not to create and actual image file. For Java, there is an example provided which writes a PNG file, but not for C++. The author of the library also has another C++ library, Tiny-PNG-Out. It is correct up until 700 megapixel PNG files, which I hope your QR code never hits. I've written a class which bridges the two together, allowing you to both generate the QR code and write it to a PNG file, scaled up to be as readable as possible.</description>

                <description>One of my Raspberry Pi's would not boot up after a reboot. The SD card was corrupted, sadly beyond repair. This article walks you through the steps I took to try to fix the SD card, including fsck, badblocks and other filesystem utilities. It also has tips to reduce the writing on the Raspberry Pi, this to save SD cards from some amount of wear and thus possible corruption.</description>
