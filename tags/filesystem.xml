                <description>The QR-Code-Generator library by Project Nayuki for C++ gives you an easy, fast and correct way to generate QR codes. However, you get just a data structure, showing that data is up to you. An example is provided to print the code to a terminal, but not to create and actual image file. For Java, there is an example provided which writes a PNG file, but not for C++. The author of the library also has another C++ library, Tiny-PNG-Out. It is correct up until 700 megapixel PNG files, which I hope your QR code never hits. I've written a class which bridges the two together, allowing you to both generate the QR code and write it to a PNG file, scaled up to be as readable as possible.</description>

                <description>One of my Raspberry Pi's would not boot up after a reboot. The SD card was corrupted, sadly beyond repair. This article walks you through the steps I took to try to fix the SD card, including fsck, badblocks and other filesystem utilities. It also has tips to reduce the writing on the Raspberry Pi, this to save SD cards from some amount of wear and thus possible corruption.</description>
