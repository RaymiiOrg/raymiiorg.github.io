                <description>I like to tinker with old hardware. The [DEC](https://raymii.org/s/tags/dec.html) PDP-8 is my favorite [retro computer](/s/tags/pdp-8.html) and [Office 2003](/s/blog/Using_a_Windows_Mobile_2003_PDA_hp_ipaq_in_2022_including_whatsapp.html) is the best version ever released IMHO.  One of my other favorite retro devices is the HP Jornada 720. A small `handheld PC` (smaller than a netbook) running Windows CE or in my case, Linux. It has a decent keyboard, CFL backlit screen, **32 MB of RAM(!)**, a compact Flash card for storage and a stylus for the resistive touchscreen. Oh and I got a 10Mbit PCMCIA network card, but wireless cards are also still available. It might be old, released in 1999, but can do one thing your modern iPhone can't. </description>

                <title>Using a Windows Mobile 2003 PDA (HP iPAQ h4350) in 2022, including WhatsApp!</title>

                <description>While cleaning out my collection of electronics, I found a PDA. Not the modern kind (voice assistant), but the old school precursor to the smartphone. It's a HP iPAQ h4350, it was a model used by the Dutch Railways. I picked it up in working condition years ago and was wondering, how does a mobile device from 2003 stack up to a modern smartphone? The first thing I did was run linux on it which worked surprisingly well, it however was noticeably slower than Windows Mobile. This post shows you how well the device still works in 2022, including using WhatsApp to chat. Almost all things I use my smartphone for, I can do with this PDA!</description>
