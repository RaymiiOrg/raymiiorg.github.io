                <title>Adding IPv6 to a keepalived and haproxy cluster</title>

                <description>At work I regularly build high-available clusters for customers, where the setup is distributed over multiple datacenters with failover software. If one component fails, the service doesn't experience issues or downtime due to the failure. Recently I was tasked with expanding a cluster setup to be also reachable via IPv6. This article goes over the settings and configuration required for haproxy and keepalived for IPv6. The internal cluster will only be IPv4, the loadbalancer terminates HTTP and HTTPS connections. </description>

                <title>Traceroute IPv6 to Smokeping Target config</title>

                <description>This little one-liner converts the output of traceroute for IPv6 to Smokeping Target output. I had only setup my smokepings for IPv4. Recently we had an issue were network config was borked and the whole IPv4 network was not announced via BGP anymore. I was at home troubleshooting, but finding nothing since I have native IPv6 and that part still worked. My Smokeping did show loss, and that explicitly uses IPv4. That helped with the debugging a lot. I have a [IPv4][4] version of this article as well.</description>

                <description>At work and at home my ISP's have native IPv6. I recently was at a clients location where they had no IPv6 at all and had to set up and demonstrate an application in a Docker container with IPv6 functionality. They said the had IPv6 but on location it appeared that IPv6 wasn't working. Since IPv6 was required for the demo the container needed a workaround. This article describes the workaround I used to add IPv6 to a Docker container on a non IPv6 network.</description>

                <description>One of my Raspberry Pi's was running a test setup of the Citadel groupware service. The test was sucessfull, so I set up a real world setup. The Raspberry Pi would serve another purpose, namely, a Linux Torrent seedbox. As in, to seed Linux torrents from linuxtracker.org. I choose Transmission for this, because it is simple, fast and stable. Transmission has a good webinterface, plus it allows access from remote clients with the transmission-remote gui packages. This article shows you how to set it up on a Raspberry Pi running Arch Linux.</description>
