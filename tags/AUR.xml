                <description>The AUR is a nice feature from Arch Linux, it allows anyone to create and upload a simple package build script, PKGBUILD, for a piece of software which is not in the repositories. Sometimes however, the PKGBUILD is outdated. You then need to manually fix it, by changing the download link or version. With a new version you get new checksums, and the makepkg command has a neat feature which generates the checksums for you.</description>
