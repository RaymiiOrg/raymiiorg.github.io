                <description>For a small personal project that talks to a few JSON API's and does some data parsing I needed a header only C++ HTTP library. Header only because that is the simplest way to include it in my project, just copy and paste the file. I came across the project cpp-httplib, which fits my needs, does all the http methods, small, a few examples and it looks modern and has recent development commits. Setup and getting it working was easy, but as soon as I tried an https url, I got an exception ('https scheme is not supported.'). This guide shows you how to setup cpp-httplib for SSL support with cmake. It took me a bit longer than I wanted to set it up correctly, so why not save you the effort.</description>

                <title>Chrome 68 is depcrecating HPKP (HTTP Public Key Pinning)</title>

                <description>In 2014 I published an article on HPKP, http public key pinning. It allows a site operator to send a public key in an http header, forcing the browser to only connect when that header is found. It was ment to redice the risk of a compromised certificate authority (since any CA can create a certificate for any website). Quite secure, but it was often wrongly configured, forgotten until certificates expired and there were some security issues like a false pin. Late 2017 Google announced that HPKP would be removed in Chrome 68 and that version is released now, so HPKP is no longer supported. This post goes into the reasoning behind the removal, the possible replacement (Expect-CT) and how to remove HPKP from your site.</description>

                <description>HTTP Strict Transport Security (often abbreviated as HSTS) is a security feature that lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. This tutorial will show you how to set up HSTS in Apache2, NGINX and Lighttpd.</description>

                <title>HTTP Public Key Pinning Extension HPKP for Apache, NGINX and Lighttpd</title> 
                <link>https://raymii.org/s/articles/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning_Extension_HPKP.html?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=raymii&amp;utm_campaign=tagrss</link>

                <description>Public Key Pinning means that a certificate chain must include a whitelisted public key. It ensures only whitelisted Certificate Authorities (CA) can sign certificates for `*.example.com`, and not any CA in your browser store. This article has background theory and configuration examples for Apache, Lighttpd and NGINX.</description>
