                <description>Property bindings are one of the most powerful concepts in Qt/QML. Property bindings let you specify relationships between different object properties. When a properties dependencies change in value, the property is automatically updated according to the specified relationship. The QML engine monitors the properties dependencies (that is, the variables in the binding expression). When a change is detected, the QML engine re-evaluates the binding expression and applies the new result to the property.
One little known caveat with property bindings is that they break after a static JavaScript assignment (`property = value`). This post shows you the different behaviors and how to use `Qt.binding()` to assign property bindings via JavaScript.</description>
