                <description>This article contains both an end user and OpenStack administrator guide to set up and use soft_delete with OpenStack Nova. If an instance is deleted with nova delete, it's gone right away. If soft_delete is enabled, it will be queued for deletion for a set amount of time, allowing end-users and administrators to restore the instance with the nova restore command. This can save your ass (or an end-users bottom) if the wrong instance is removed. Setup is simple, just one variable in nova.conf. There are some caveats we'll also discuss here. </description>
