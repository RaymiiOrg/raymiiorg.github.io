                <description>For an unrelated piece of code, I recently spent a few days trying to figure out if there was a portable, modern C++ way to handle user input with a timeout. If there is no input after a few seconds, the program can continue doing other things. TL;DR, there is none, since stdin is blocking I/O. At the end of the article I'll also provide the code I ended up using, which uses two actual big-boy threads, one for input and one for 'other work'.</description>
