I wrote a script which combines dialog, awk and bash to make a nifty ssh script.
First of, copy this script to your pc:

    echo "4,Router,root,192.168.1.1,22"
    echo; echo "If you want the current user to be used as the username then use a - (dash)."
    echo "Each value is separated by a , (comma), and make sure you don't have double numbers. If you have only the first number will work."

    echo "Connecting user $UNAME2 to ${HOSTN[$SSHOST]} on port ${HOSTP[$SSHOST]}."
    ssh  $WHICHSSH -p ${HOSTP[$SSHOST]}
    echo "ssh terminated, byebye"

    echo "You selected exit, we will quit"
    exit 0

    nano $HOSTSFILE
    exec bash $0
    exit 0

    echo "You pressed ESC, we will exit.";
    exit 0
    ;;
    esac
    
    rm -f $TEMPF
    exit 0
    

Now comes the hard part, creating your hosts file.

The script wants it to be in the same directory as the script with the name
`hosts`. This is the syntax:

    
    
    ID,Friendly name,username,host or ip,port
    1,VPS 1,-,vps.example.org,22
    2,VPS 2,www,vps.someserver.com,2222
    3,Home Router,root,192.168.1.1,22
    4,Homeserver,-,192.168.1.10,22
    5,Work,ceo,my.work.com,22 
    

If you want the current user to be used as the username then use a `-` (dash) as
username.

Please double check your comma's and your numbers, if something is wrong the
script can give strange errors.
