The [YouLess](https://youless.nl/home.html) is a device that can help you monitor energy usage. It works on so called smart meters using a P1 port, it can monitor solar panels but it also works with regular old analog meters. I have an old style analog meter but I like gadgets and monitoring / reducing my energy usage just as much as the next guy so I bought one. It has an optical sensor that you paste (with tape) on your meter and that detects a little black bar on the rotor disc and using a rpm factor on your meter it calculates the electricity used.
I has some trouble with the device when I set it up, it turned out to be aligned wrongly. It sometimes missed the black bar, so the numbers were incorrect.
I wrote a little application using Qt and QML to show the raw light sensor values in a line graph to help me align the YouLess correctly. This post tells you more about the application, which of course is open source.

This is a screenshot of the Windows build of YouLessQt. The marked dips
in the graph are the light sensor values when a pulse is detected:

The YouLess in my case detects the little black stripe on the analog
electricity meter, as shown in the below picture:

![analog meter][5]


When I first got the YouLess, I placed it on the analog meter but after a
few hours it missed pulses, the count didn't match the actual meter. After 
fiddling around to get a Windows 7 gadget installed on Windows 11 and re-aligning
the YouLess a few times, it picked up all the pulses. The most time-consuming 
part was to get that Windows 7 gadget up and running, it crashes a lot. So I
decided to write a bit of Qt/QML to make this experience better. 

The use-case is limited since there are not a lot of analog meters here in The
Netherlands, most households have had their electricity meter replaced for free
with a so called Smart Meter (with a P1 port), a digital meter. But even with
a very limited use case, who needs an excuse to write some line-graph code in
JavaScript for QML using the Canvas API? After my recent experience of 
[drawing a Circle in QML][12], I'm starting to like how easy it is to quickly
draw custom shapes with it.

This post is [not sponsored nor endorsed by YouLess][13]. I wrote this app myself
to help me align the device to the meter correctly using the open API they 
provide. I paid for the device myself. 

You can download the Android app on the [Google Play Store here][10] and the
source code is [available under the GPLv3 here][11]. On GitHub you'll also
find a release APK if you do not want to use the Play Store.


### YouLessQt

YouLessQt is written in C++ using Qt and QML, because that is what I currently
use most of the time for my cross-platform app development. It uses mostly QML,
It is nothing more than a `Timer` which does a JSON API call and plots a line
chart with some values.

The [HTTP calls are done in QML using xmlhttpreqeust as I wrote on last year][8].

The API is described in the [the YouLess manual][14]. There is 1 api endpoint
that has the raw lightsensor value. The documentation states not to use it 
for electricity data, but since my usecase is the raw value, I can safely
ignore that message. I also request a few other data points such as the 
firmware version, model, mac address and the last 1 minute energy usage, 
but that request is done only once when connecting, not every 250ms.

The application also has a graph showing the most recent current power usage 
value and the value 1 minute before that. It however is not intended as a
general YouLess application, since YouLess themselves [provide a great app][9].
If they added the raw light sensor value to that app instead of a Windows 7 gadget, 
I wouldn't have written this small app.

YouLessQt is available for [Android in the Google Play Store][11] since I suspect
you'll be near your electricity meter when you are using this (fuse box). My
computer is in my office, nowhere near my electricity meter, so a mobile app is
way more useful. If you'd like a Windows build of YouLessQt, please send me an 
email, I'd happily build an installer if there is an interest for it.


YouLessQt is not intended as a replacement for the official [YouLess app][15]. 
It does not support selecting different inputs (like S0, Gas meter, etc) and
it has no history. The only intended use case is when aligning the YouLess
to you analog meter. 

### The Windows Gadget

YouLess provides a Windows 7 gadget named RawMon to monitor the specific 
value regarding the pulses. There is a workaround for modern Windows (10/11)
but in my case that was very unstable and my computer is nowhere near my
electricity meter. 


Quoting [YouLess support][4] (translated to English):

> In Belgium, analogue electricity meters are often housed in an additional
 (semi)transparent plastic casing. Is this the case for you as well?

> As a result, the distance between Youless and the rotating disk is often
  greater than without the plastic casing. Due to the weaker signal, it is
  often necessary to adjust the sensitivity of the Youless device to
  accommodate this situation.

> We have a Windows tool in the form of a Windows gadget that can visualize the
  reflection of the rotating disk in a graph. This tool is helpful for
  adjusting the sensitivity. You can download this tool here:

[http://www.youless.nl/tl_files/downloads/rawmon-0.2.zip][6]

> If you are using Windows 8, the raw monitor gadget can be used with the
  8gadget pack:

[http://www.youless.nl/blogpost/items/gadget-windows-8.html][7]

> The Youless device is designed to count a dip in the reflected light intensity
  of approximately 45% as a pulse by default. With the Windows tool, the graph
  typically looks like this:

![siemens red][3]

> There is a clear, sharp dip in the signal when the bar passes by. The clearer
  the dip (relative), the better. If the average input level is low, it is not
  a problem as long as the dip is distinguishable.

> This dip will be less clear due to the increased distance if there is an
 additional plastic casing. The threshold parameter "lw" can be adjusted by
 entering the following URL in a browser (replace the example IP address 1.2.3.4
 with your own Youless IP address):

> http://1.2.3.4/M?lw=105

> What this means is that with "lw" set to 105, the Youless device will consider
  a dip of 100/105=0.95 (or a 5% relative decrease) from the average reflection
  level as a pulse. The default factory value of "lw" is 180, so setting it to
  105 increases sensitivity significantly. The "lw" value must be at least
  101.

> The suggested parameter value of 105 usually works well for meters in an
  additional plastic casing. From the reflection graph, you can derive the
  optimal value for "lw" if needed.
