and the visual side is created with the HTML5 Kickstart framework by Joshua

##### Why use this over something like remember the milk, wunderlist or any

other cloud service?

  * No ads
  * Nobody selling your data
  * Nobody monitoring your activity
  * Data is easy to get out (no vendor lock-in) and to backup.
  * Offline mode? Host it on your local machine with a LAMP/WAMP/MAMP server.
  * Sync? Use a syncing service on the hosts ([owncloud][3] and [sparkleshare][4] are quite good) and point the program to a json file in that folder.
  * Offline sync? Combine above 2 points, or put the software in a git, svn or other version control system repo.
