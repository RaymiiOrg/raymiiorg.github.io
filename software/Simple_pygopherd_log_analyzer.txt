statistics. If you ever used [Logwatch][1] you'll feel at home.

[Github repository here][2] or just [the script here][3].

### Requirements

  * pygopherd (tested with 2.0.18)
  * syslog of some kind
  * bash 4+

### Installation

  * Clone the git repository or save the shell script somewhere
  * Make the script executable (`chmod +x ./pygopherstats.sh`)
  * Run it providing one or more logfiles to analyze:
    
        ./pygopherstats.sh /var/log/syslog
    

./pygopherstats.sh /var/log/syslog /var/log/syslog.1 ./pygopherstats.sh
/var/log/syslog.*

If you don't have a central syslog server, use poor man's ssh to get all the log
files from all the servers:

    
    
    for host in $(dig +short a example.org); do 
        ssh -l root $host "zgrep pygopherd /var/log/syslog.*"; 
    done 2>/dev/null > gopherlog
    

### Example report

    Hostname: example.org
