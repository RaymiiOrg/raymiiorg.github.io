This script will help you with nursing-related infusion and drip speed
calculations.  
**Also available as an online tool, scroll down for the link**.

    NurseCalc infuus by Raymii.org. READ LICENSE
    Usage: ./infuus.sh $HOEVEELHEID $DRUPPELSNELHEID $TIJDSDUUR $DRUPPELSML
    Two variables are needed, the other will be calculated. Unknown variable should be entered as 0
    LAST VARIABLE (drips per ml) IS REQUIRED!
    $HOEVEELHEID = Total amount of drips
    $DRUPPELSNELHEID = drip speed in drips/min
    $TIJDSDUUR = Total time infusion needs to run in min
    $DRUPPELSML = drips in 1 ml of fluid. Most fluids have 20dr/ml
    Decimal hours to minutes: 4.87 hours = 0.87 hours * 0.60 = 4 hours and 52 minutes
    Calculate total amount of drips = dr/ml * total ml = 20 dr/ml * 2400 ml = 48000 drips total
    example: ./infuus.sh 2 85 2 0 will output 85 minutes.
    example: ./infuus.sh 40 90 720 0 will output 5 liters per minute

### Online version

Thanks to the [Illumination Software Creator application builder][2] I've made
an online version. Same license, has bugs, not ready for production, regular
blabla.. Use on your own risk.
