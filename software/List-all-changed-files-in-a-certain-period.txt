This is a little script I wrote and use to get a daily report of all the files
that have changed on my servers. What it does is list all the files that are
modified within a certain time period from a given directory. It can also be run
from a desktop machine, or any machine which runs bash, find and ls. Usage is
simple, save the script, chmod +x it, then run (./report.sh). If you want a
specific directory to be scanned run it like ./report.sh /var/www/my/dir

    #Change these values to your need
    #Exclude hidden directories, 0=exclude,1=include
    HIDDEN=0
    #Time parameter in days for modified files
    MTIME="-1"
    #Directory to look for files, if unset use current dir
    FILEDIR=$1
    if [ -z "$FILEDIR" ]; then
    FILEDIR="./";
    fi
    SVERSION="0.2"
    HOSTPC=`hostname`
    HOSTUSER=`whoami`
    
    #Now do the  find thing
    
    case "$HIDDEN" in
    
        0) echo "Reporting all files modified in last "$MTIME" period in directory "$FILEDIR" for system "$HOSTPC", running as user "$HOSTUSER" excluding hidden files."
        echo "Date: `date`"
        echo "START OF FILE REPORT"
        find $FILEDIR -type f -mtime $MTIME ! -path "*/.*" | xargs -r ls -lh 2>/dev/null
        echo "END OF FILE REPORT"
        echo "Report script version $SVERSION by raymii.org"
        ;;
    
        1) echo "Reporting all files modified in last "$MTIME" period in directory "$FILEDIR" for system "$HOSTPC", running as user "$HOSTUSER"."
        echo "Date: `date`"
        echo "START OF FILE REPORT"
        find $FILEDIR -type f -mtime $MTIME | xargs -r ls -lh 2>/dev/null
        echo "END OF FILE REPORT"
        echo "Report script version $SVERSION by raymii.org"
        ;;
    
    esac
    #END OF SCRIPT
    

Sample output looks like this:

    
    
    remy@USN4 ~/test $ ./report.sh ~
    Reporting all files modified in last "-1" period in directory "/home/remy" for system "USN4" excluding hidden files.
    Date: Fri Mar 30 13:20:59 CEST 2012
    START OF FILE REPORT
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 remy remy    6 2012-03-30 12:54 /home/remy/hoi.test
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 remy remy    0 2012-03-30 12:55 /home/remy/test/hallo
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 remy remy    0 2012-03-30 12:55 /home/remy/test/i
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 remy remy    0 2012-03-30 13:15 /home/remy/test/me.f
    -rwxrwxr-x 1 remy remy 1.2K 2012-03-30 13:20 /home/remy/test/report.sh
    END OF FILE REPORT
    Report script version 0.2 by raymii.org
    

If you want to filter out certain directories you can add grep to the find line
in the script to filter out directories:

    
    
    find $FILEDIR -type f -mtime $MTIME ! -path "*/.*" | grep -v "/sys/" | grep -v "/proc/" | grep -v "/run/" | grep -v "/dev/" | xargs -r ls -lh 2>/dev/null
    

The above command wil filter out the /sys/ /proc/ /run/ and /dev/ directories.
Edit it to your needs. I've got a crontab like this, it saves it to the
/var/log/freport/ directory so you can check it later or email it:

    
    
    00 */8 * * * /root/report.sh / > /var/log/freport/filereport`date +%F`.txt
