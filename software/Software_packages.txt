#### Software Packages

Some software I encounter does not have a debian .deb package available. Via the
./configure, make, sudo checkinstall I compile them into a package and put it up
here for download. There are also .rpm packages, but these are untested and only
the .deb versions converted with alien.

##### Logstalgia

02 sept 2012: Logstalgia is a website traffic visualization that replays or
streams web-server access logs as a pong-like battle between the web server and
an never ending torrent of requests.

##### Gource

31 aug 2012: Gource is a software version control visualization tool. Software
projects are displayed by Gource as an animated tree with the root directory of
the project at its centre. Directories appear as branches with files as leaves.
Developers can be seen working on the tree at the times they contributed to the
project. Currently Gource includes built-in log generation support for Git,
Mercurial and Bazaar and SVN (as of 0.29). Gource can also parse logs produced
by several third party tools for CVS repositories.

  * [gource 0.38 x64 .deb package, tested under Ubuntu 12.04-x64][6]
  * [gource 0.38 x64 .rpm package, UNTESTED, deb converted with alien][7]

##### Sudosh2

27 aug 2012: sudosh is an auditing shell filter and can be used as a login
shell. Sudosh records all keystrokes and output and can play back the session as
just like a VCR. Sudosh2 is a continuation of the development of sudosh.

**This version of sudosh2 is compiled with bash as the default shell instead of
sh. This can be changed in the configuration file in /etc/sudosh.conf.**
