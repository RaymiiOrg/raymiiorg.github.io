I decided to change email server for several reasons, anyway, long story short I
was using postfix(qmail before that) and decided to switch to citadel, which is
much easier to deal with (simple config).

Anyway, Citadel use it's own format for emails (Berkeley DB), so you can't just
copy over the existing emails stored in Maildir format (8 years worth !), but
since Citadel provides an IMAP server, all I need is a tool that can copy/upload
The IMAP folder(s) content to an IMAP server.

I thought that would already exist, easy to find, but did not seem to find one.
I found one made in PERL, but as usual Perl / CPAN failed me completely :(

I found another one that was really bare bone but usable here:
http://www.robsayers.com/computing/MaildirToImap.html

It's quite compact and easy to use, tanks to ruby, but it was kinda hard coded
to copy just the Inbox folder ... in my case I had many subfolders (Sent,
archives and so on) that I wanted to copy as well, so I modified it a little to
make it "parameterizable", so i could run it against other sub folders of my
choice.

Usage

  * Prerequisite: You need a ruby install (`apt-get install ruby`)
  * Save the script (scroll down) to your machine (MaildirToImap.rb)
  * Edit the script ans set the variables IMAP _HOST, IMAP_ USER, and IMAP_PASS to correct values.
  * Use the script with 2 params(absolute directory of a Maildir Inbox, IMAP box name), see examples:

Example: Copy the Inbox

    
    
    ruby MaildirToImap.rb /home/tcolar/Maildir/cur/ INBOX
    

Example: Copy an Inbox sub-folder (ex: 'Sent')

    
    
    ruby MaildirToImap.rb /home/tcolar/Maildir/.Sent/cur/ INBOX/Sent
    

Repeat for all the sub-folders you want to copy.

It takes about 0.5 seconds per email (on a local server), so if you have many
emails it can take a while.

The script:

    # Inspired by: http://www.robsayers.com/computing/MaildirToImap.html
    # WARNING: Come with no warranties of any kind whatsoever, use at your own risk !
    #
    # Use, Example: ruby MaildirToImap.rb /home/tcolar/Maildir/cur INBOX
    # Example(sub-box): ruby MaildirToImap.rb /home/tcolar/Maildir/.Sent/cur/ INBOX/Sent
    
    #vars - set accordingly
    IMAP_HOST = 'localhost'
    IMAP_USER = 'me'
    IMAP_PASS = 'my_password'
    TEST_MODE = 0 # Set to 0 to actually do it
    
    # program
    require 'net/imap'
    
    def upload_dir(imap, mail_dir, imap_dir)
            imap.examine(imap_dir)
            msgs = Dir.entries(mail_dir).each do |f|
            if !File.directory?(f) then
                    print &quot;Will add &quot;, mail_dir, f, &quot;t to: &quot;, imap_dir, &quot;n&quot;
                    if TEST_MODE == 0 then
                            imap.append(imap_dir,File.open(mail_dir+f).read,[:Seen])
                    end
            end
            end
    end
    
    # Main
    if ARGV.length &lt; 2 then
            print &quot;Expecting 2 params: - maildir directory (usually ends with /cur) - IMAP dirn&quot;
            exit
    end
    
    mail_dir=ARGV[0]
    imap_dir=ARGV[1]
    imap = Net::IMAP.new(IMAP_HOST)
    imap.authenticate('LOGIN', IMAP_USER, IMAP_PASS)
    begin
            imap.create(imap_dir)
    rescue
            print &quot;Failed creating: &quot;, imap_dir, &quot;, that's probably OKn&quot;
    end
    upload_dir(imap, mail_dir, imap_dir)
