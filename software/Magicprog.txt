I'm a fervent [Magic the Gathering][1] player. If you do not know what magic is,
scroll down for an explanation. I play it a lot in my free time, and I
participate in bootserdrafts and casual tournaments here locally. I've developed
a program to keep the life in a 2 player game. It's called MagicProg. It will
also work for TGC's like pokemon, yu-gi-oh, WoW TCG or any other TGC. And it has
a note area.

> MagicProg was made with [Illumination Software Creator][8]. The only cross-

No code required, works like a charm. I've also written [Terrible Start][9],
[NurseCalc Infuus][10] and [NurseCalc o2][11] with it. The creator of ISC is
also the host of the Linux Action Show (Bryan Lunduke). Check it out and buy it!

### Bugs

  * HTML5 version's note area is not the right size in some browsers
  * Python version's note area has no text at the start, but is usable

### What is Magic?

From [wikipedia:][12]

    
    
    Magic: The Gathering (MTG; also known as Magic) is one of the first collectible trading card games, created by Richard Garfield and introduced in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast. Magic continues to thrive, with approximately twelve million players as of 2011. Magic can be played by two or more players each using a deck of printed cards or a deck of virtual cards through the Internet-based Magic: The Gathering Online or third-party programs.  
    Each game represents a battle between mighty wizards, known as "planeswalkers", who employ the magical spells, items, and fantastic creatures depicted on individual Magic cards to defeat their opponents. Although the original concept of the game drew heavily from the motifs of traditional fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons && Dragons, the gameplay of Magic bears little similarity to pencil-and-paper adventure games, while having substantially more cards and more complex rules than many other card games.  
    An organized tournament system and a community of professional Magic players has developed, as has a secondary market for Magic cards. Magic cards can be valuable due to their rarity and utility in game play.
