This is a simple munin plugin which shows you the amount of log messages your
logstash/kibana server receives per hour. It should run on the Logstash host, it
gets the data from out the Elasticsearch database.

## Setup instructions

You need CURL, so you might need to install that via your package manager.

Clone the git repository:

    
    
    git clone git://github.com/RaymiiOrg/munin-plugins.git
    

Place the plugin file in `/usr/share/munin/plugins/`, make it executable and
create a symlink in `/etc/munin/plugins/`

    
    
    cd munin-plugins
    cp logstash-messages-per-hour.sh /usr/share/munin/plugins
    chmod +x /usr/share/munin/plugins/logstash-messages-per-hour.sh
    ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/logstash-messages-per-hour.sh /etc/munin/plugins/logstash
    

Edit the plugin if your elasticsearch database URL is on another host:

    
    
    # Edit the following line, and change localhost to what it should be
    TOTAL_EVENTS=$(curl -s -k -XGET http://localhost:9200/logstash
    

Then wait until your munin server has updated, and enjoy.
