Proxmox VE is a complete virtualization management solution for servers. You can
virtualize even the most demanding application workloads running on Linux and
Windows Servers. It is based on the leading Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)
hypervisor and OpenVZ, the number one solution for container based
virtualization.

[Proxmox Website][1]

ProxMox VE is a very nice piece of software to setup a VM host very fast, which
also is easy manageable via a webinterface. It supports both OpenVZ and KVM. I
use it to manage a few VM's to test stuff on and it works really great.

However, I'm a command line lover, and I thought it would be nice to be able to
"Manage" Proxmox VE from a bash shell. And I've written a script to do just
that.

proxbash.sh is a bash script to manage your Proxmox VE server.

##### Features

  * Add OpenVZ containers
  * Remove OpenVZ containers
  * Start / Stop OpenVZ containers
  * List all OpenVZ containers and KVM virtual machines
  * Shell dropper into OpenVZ containers
  * Command execution in openvz containers

As you can see there is a lot of OpenVZ and not a lot of KVM. Most of the VM's I
use are OpenVZ, so for the KVM things you need to use the webinterface.

##### Download

[Click here to download the script][4]

Or use this:

    
    
    wget https://raymii.org/s/inc/software/proxbash.sh; chmod +x ./proxbash.sh; ./proxbash.sh
    

##### Usage

Before you start, edit the script variables:

    
    
    VAR_PROXMOXHOST="192.168.0.25"    #proxmox server IP
    VAR_PROXMOXSSH="22"         #proxmox ssh port
    VAR_PROXMOXUSER="root"          #proxmox ssh user
    VAR_PROXMOX_NODE="proxmox"      #proxmox cluster node name
    

and set up passwordless key auth to the proxmox node. If you don't do that, you
have to enter the proxmox root password every time.

**Also edit the case statement for the templates. Default it has ubuntu 10.04
and 12.04 and centos 5 and 6.**

Replace $CTID with an openvz ct id. (like 103, 104)

###### Create a CT

    
    
    proxbash.sh createct node-hostname node-password node-template node-ram node-disk node-ip
    proxbash.sh createct prod001 supersecret1 ubuntu12 1024 15 172.20.5.48
    

proxbash.sh createct node-hostname node-password node-template node-ram node-
disk node-ip $CTID

###### Start/Stop a CT

    
    
    ./proxbash.sh startct 
    ./proxbash.sh startct $CTID   
    
    ./proxbash.sh stopct
    ./proxbash.sh stopct $CTID
    

###### Remove a CT

    
    
    ./proxbash.sh deletect
    ./proxbash.sh deletect $CTID
    

###### Shell dropper

    
    
    ./proxbash.sh shelldrop $CTID
    

###### Execute commands in CT

    
    
    ./proxbash.sh execinct $CTID "commands you -want -to; execute; in the ../ct" 
    

###### List CTs/VMs

    
    
    ./proxbash.sh listcts
    ./proxbash.sh listvms
    

###### Get CT info

    
    
    ./proxbash.sh ctinfo
    ./proxbash.sh ctinfo $CTID
