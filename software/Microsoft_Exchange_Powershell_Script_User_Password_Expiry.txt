This is a small PowerShell script which emails your users that their password is
going to expire in X days. This is needed when you have an Active Directory and
Exchange Environment, but your users do not log in to a Windows machine bound to
the Active Directory, but for example a Mac OS X or Linux machine with Full Disk
Encryption enabled. Then they are not notified that their password is about to
expire. This script can run as a scheduled task and scan and email your users
that their password is about to expire.

It is tested on a Windows Server 2008 environment, with Exchange 2010. Domain is
not running in Mixed mode, all servers are Windows Server 2008 R2. The script is
installed as a scheduled task on one of the Exchange Edge servers with the SMTP
role, but it does not have to be there, because the SMTP server variable is
configurable. The amount of days to email before a password expires is also
configurable.

### PowerShell setup

First we need to allow execution of unsigned Powershell scripts. _This can be
dangerous, so make sure your server security is adequate._ Fire up a `cmd.exe`
_with elevated privileges, run it as admin_ and launch `powershell`. Then
execute the following command:

    
    
    Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted
    

This does the following:

    
    
    Load all configuration files and run all scripts.
    If you run an unsigned script that was downloaded from the
    internet, you are prompted for permission before it runs.

### The script

    
    
    $ExpireDays = 30
    $SendingEmail = "helpdesk@example.org"
    $SMTPHost="127.0.0.1"
    Import-Module ActiveDirectory
    $AllUsers = get-aduser -filter * -properties * |where {$_.Enabled -eq "True"} | where { $_.PasswordNeverExpires -eq $false } | where { $_.passwordexpired -eq $false }
    foreach ($User in $AllUsers)
    {
      $Name = (Get-ADUser $User | foreach { $_.Name})
      $Email = $User.emailaddress
      $PasswdSetDate = (get-aduser $User -properties * | foreach { $_.PasswordLastSet })
      $MaxPasswdAge = (Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy).MaxPasswordAge
      $ExpireDate = $PasswdSetDate + $MaxPasswdAge
      $Today = (get-date)
      $DaysToExpire = (New-TimeSpan -Start $Today -End $ExpireDate).Days
      $EmailSubject="Password Expiry Notice - your password expires in $DaystoExpire days"
      $Message="
      Dear $Name,
      <p> Your Password expires in $DaysToExpire days.<br />
      To change your password, please go to https://webmail.example.org/owa/, log in and click the settings button, then click Change Password. <br />
      If you do not update your password in $DaysToExpire days, you will not be able to log in, so please make sure you update your password. <br />
      If you need any help, contact us via email: helpdesk@example.org, by internal phone 1337, or walk by Building C, Floor 4, Room C41A. <br />
      Sincerely, <br />
      The IT Department. <br />
      </p>"
      if ($DaysToExpire -lt $ExpireDate)
      {
        echo "$Email expires in $DaysToExpire days"
        Send-Mailmessage -smtpServer $SMTPHost -from $SendingEmail -to $Email -subject $EmailSubject -body $Message -bodyasHTML -priority High
    
      } 
    }
    

Save this as a `.ps1` script, for example `Expiry-Mail-30.ps1`. Then set up a
scheduled task to run every night, without the user being logged in, as action
executing this script. It will send out an email to all users with a password
that expires in 30 days, it will keep doing so until they change it.

### For the helpdesk

You can also change the script to send the email directly to the IT helpdesk, so
that they can manually contact the user. Or you can do it both, or create a copy
script and task with the `$ExpireDays` set to 2 and the email to IT Helpdesk, so
that the user has a month to change their password, and the IT staff can help
the user before it is to late.
