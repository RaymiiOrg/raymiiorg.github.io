This tutorial shows you how to have NGINX use different folders as different
upstream proxy's.

By default, if you have a `location` block which has a proxy pass, and the
`location` block is a folder, for example `/wiki`, the folder is sent back to
the proxied server:

    
    
    location /nagios/ {
        proxy_pass  http://10.0.21.8:80/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
        proxy_redirect    off;
    }
    

The above block will, when browsed, sent you to `http://10.0.21.8/nagios/`,
because that is the nginx location. However, if you want it to go to
`http://10.0.21.8/` you either have to rewrite or use the `/` location.

The below example has the correct rewrite rule:

    
    
    location /nagios/ {
        rewrite ^/nagios(/.*)$ $1 break;
        proxy_pass  http://10.0.21.8:80/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
        proxy_redirect    off;
    }
    

As you can see, this line:

    
    
    rewrite ^/collectd(/.*)$ $1 break;
    

fixes the above problem, and sends you to `http://10.0.21.8/` instead of
`http://10.0.21.8/nagios`.
