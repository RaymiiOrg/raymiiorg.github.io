On Ubuntu 18.04 and up, when you login via SSH you are greeted with some news
via `motd` (message of the day) that includes advertisements and messages from
Canonical (via `motd.ubuntu.com`). This small guide shows you how to disable
news, (parts of) the dynamic motd or just revert back to a plain old `/etc/motd`
file.

### (Dynamic) motd

Since 2009 Ubuntu has had a dynamic `motd`. It uses a bunch of files and scripts
in `/etc/update-motd/` to construct a message. I think since Ubuntu 17.04, but
I'm not sure, the online service was introduced. It's just a webpage that your
server [checks every 12 hours and puts in a file][2] that ends up in your
`motd`. [You can visist motd.ubuntu.com in your browser][3] to check the current
news. (But why would you when it's in your face when you login)

Here's what it currently looks like:

    
    
    Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-43-generic x86_64)
    
     * Documentation:  https://help.ubuntu.com
     * Management:     https://landscape.canonical.com
     * Support:        https://ubuntu.com/advantage
    
      System information as of Mon Mar 18 05:58:11 UTC 2019
    
      System load:  0.11               Processes:           100
      Usage of /:   40.1% of 24.06GB   Users logged in:     0
      Memory usage: 45%                IP address for eth0: 10.184.24.87
      Swap usage:   0%                 
    
      => There is 1 zombie process.
    
     * Ubuntu's Kubernetes 1.14 distributions can bypass Docker and use containerd
       directly, see https://bit.ly/ubuntu-containerd or try it now with
    
         snap install microk8s --channel=1.14/beta --classic
    
      Get cloud support with Ubuntu Advantage Cloud Guest:
        http://www.ubuntu.com/business/services/cloud
    
     * Canonical Livepatch is available for installation.
       - Reduce system reboots and improve kernel security. Activate at:
         https://ubuntu.com/livepatch
    
    0 packages can be updated.
    0 updates are security updates.
    

Lot's of useful information (load, zombie processes, reboot required, updates),
but also stuff I'm not interested in (Canonical live patching, support
kubernetes).

It's also a way for canonical to measure how many ubuntu servers there are
active. If every server connects at least every 12 hours back to the mothership,
they will be able to get measurements on when and where Ubuntu is used. Nothing
wrong with that, but I don't like the fact that they shoved it in via the
`motd`. Yes it could be useful for a `heartbleed` scale problem but my guess is
that this was aimed at metrics for Canonical first and they sought an excuse why
users might want it later. But again, nothing wrong with that. They let you
disable it and are open about it.

### Disabling motd news

Disabling the news part (the pingback to canonical) is simple. Edit the
following file:

    
    
    vim /etc/default/motd-news
    

Change `ENABLED=1` to `ENABLED=0`.

That's it for the small news part. If you dont want to see the other messages
you need to disable those as well.

### Disabling parts of the dynamic motd

In `/etc/update-motd.d` there are a bunch of scripts:

    
    
    ls /etc/update-motd.d/
    00-header             50-motd-news   80-livepatch          95-hwe-eol         98-reboot-required
    10-help-text          51-cloudguest  90-updates-available  97-overlayroot
    50-landscape-sysinfo  80-esm         91-release-upgrade    98-fsck-at-reboot
    

Some of them are useful for system information or to see if your ubuntu version
is still supported, but a few are, if you're not using canonical services, IMHO
not useful. These scripts must be executable [according to the manpage][5]. By
removing the execute bit you can have some scripts not shown in your dynamic
motd:

    
    
    chmod -x /etc/update-motd.d/80-livepatch
    chmod -x /etc/update-motd.d/51-cloudguest
    chmod -x /etc/update-motd.d/10-help-text
    

I do find it usefull to have some information in my motd, so with these three
disabled, the canonical spam is gone and actual information remains:

    
    
    Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-43-generic x86_64)
    
      System information as of Mon Mar 18 06:27:15 UTC 2019

      Memory usage: 42%                IP address for eth0: 10.184.24.87

      => There is 1 zombie process.
    
    0 packages can be updated.
    0 updates are security updates.

### Disabling dynamic motd entirely

I'm unsure how to actually do this since the documentation is not that clear
about it. The manpage for [dynamic motd][5] refers to the manpage for
[pam_motd][6] and both are unclear.

There seems to be not dynamic motd systemd service:

    
    
    systemctl list-unit-files | grep motd
    motd-news.service                      static
    motd.service                           masked
    motd-news.timer                        enabled
    

and on my system there was no actual `/etc/motd` file, just the dynamic scripts.

But the manpage states that `pam` is responsible for the motd so let's check
there:

    
    
    grep motd /etc/pam.d/*
    /etc/pam.d/login:session    optional   pam_motd.so motd=/run/motd.dynamic
    /etc/pam.d/login:session    optional   pam_motd.so noupdate
    [...]
    /etc/pam.d/sshd:session    optional     pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic
    /etc/pam.d/sshd:session    optional     pam_motd.so noupdate
    

The manpage says the following:

    
    
    pam_motd is a PAM module that can be used to display arbitrary motd (message of the day)
       files after a successful login. By default the /etc/motd file is shown
    [...]
     The suggested usage for /etc/pam.d/login is:
           session  optional  pam_motd.so  motd=/etc/motd
    [...]
    noupdate
               Don't run the scripts in /etc/update-motd.d to refresh the motd file.
    

Comment out the first line from the two `pam.d` files:

    
    
    #session    optional     pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic
    

Place something in the `/etc/motd` file to test:

    
    
    echo "Can't touch this!" > /etc/motd
    

Try logging in now. On my system, I got the message twice on my terminal. Why?
Because `OpenSSH`, by default sets the `PrintMotd` option to `yes`:

    
    
    PrintMotd
       Specifies whether sshd(8) should print /etc/motd when a user logs in interactively.
       (On some systems it is also printed by the shell, /etc/profile, or equivalent.)  The
       default is "yes".
    

Change that to `no` to have `pam` do the motd printing.

### Conclusion

Disabling the entire `dynamic-motd` can be done by commenting out two lines in
`/etc/pam.d/sshd`:

    
    
    session    optional     pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic
    session    optional     pam_motd.so noupdate
    

and letting `OpenSSH` handle the `motd`. You need to put stuff in `/etc/motd`
yourself for that to work. `OpenSSH` does this by default if that file exists.

Disabling specific parts of the dynamic motd can be done by removing scripts (or
making them not executable) in `/etc/update-motd.d/`.

Disabling the pingback to the canonical mothership, the `motd-news` part can be
done by changing `ENABLED=1` to `ENABLED=0` in `/etc/default/motd-news`.

Never thought that a simple message on your console could be so complex and used
for statistics and spam.
