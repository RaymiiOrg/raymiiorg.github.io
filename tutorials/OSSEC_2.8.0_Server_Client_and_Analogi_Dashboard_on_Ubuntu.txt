OSSEC is an Open Source Host-based Intrusion Detection System that performs log
analysis, file integrity checking, policy monitoring, rootkit detection, real-
time alerting and active response. It runs on most operating systems, including
Linux, MacOS, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and Windows. It also includes agentless
monitoring for use with for example Cisco, HP or Juniper hardware.

OSSEC 2.8 was [released on the 4th of June, 2014][2]. You can find the [full
release notes here][3]. New features include outputing of all alerts to a zeromq
PUB socket in JSON, more sshd rules and a lot of bugfixes.

This tutorial covers the installation of the OSSEC 2.8.0 server, the standard
OSSEC Web UI and the Analogi dashboard on Ubuntu 14.04. It also covers OSSEC
setup with MySQL support. Last but not least it shows you how to install the
OSSEC agent on a *NIX system.

[![OSSEC Analogi dashboard][4]][4]

This tutorial is written for an Ubuntu 14.04 OSSEC 2.8.0 server, but can be
easily adapted to other *NIX operating systems. It only covers basic OSSEC
client/server configuration. It gets you started, the rest is available in the
documentation: http://www.ossec.net/doc/

You can read the tutorial for [OSSEC 2.7 on Ubuntu 12.04 here.][5]

### Requirements

  * An Ubuntu 14.04 server
  * Apache2, PHP, MySQL and development packages
  * OSSEC clients to monitor (*NIX or Windows machines, Cisco switches etc).

### Installing development packages

OSSEC is installed from source, therefore you need development packages. This is
both for the OSSEC clients as for the OSSEC server:

    
    
    apt-get install build-essential make libssl-dev git
    

### Installing Apache, MySQL and PHP

This is fairly simple on Ubuntu. It is all covered with apt:

    
    
    apt-get install mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev mysql-client apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql php5-curl php5-gd php5-intl php-pear php5-imagick php5-imap php5-mcrypt php5-memcache php5-ming php5-ps php5-pspell php5-recode php5-snmp php5-sqlite php5-tidy php5-xmlrpc php5-xsl
    

Remember to set a strong root password for MySQL. Next finish MySQL with a
secure installation:

    
    
    mysql_secure_installation
    

Accept all the suggested options. Now restart all requires services:

    
    
    /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
    /etc/init.d/mysql restart
    

### Compiling the OSSEC server

Do note that OSSEC has Debian packages available. These do not include MySQL or
Postgres support, therefore we need to compile it. The packages are also at the
moment only available for OSSEC 2.7.

Download and verify OSSEC, either via wget or from the website:
http://www.ossec.net/?page_id=19

    
    
    wget http://www.ossec.net/files/ossec-hids-2.8.tar.gz
    
    md5sum ossec-hids-2.8.tar.gz
    ossec-hids-2.8.tar.gz: 90f3c54f22abe9c07661fb51ddaa8474
    

From the OSSEC website:

    
    
    MD5(ossec-hids-2.8.tar.gz)= 90f3c54f22abe9c07661fb51ddaa8474
    SHA1(ossec-hids-2.8.tar.gz)= 1d72a8cd347379ef7a533ba9633231c5bfedfa1a
    

If it is correct, then extract it:

    
    
    tar -xf ossec-hids-2.8.tar.gz
    cd ossec-hids-2.8
    

#### Database support

The Makefile error is fixed in 2.8.

This tutorial uses MySQL because the Analogi dashboard only supports MySQL.
Instructions for Postgres are included.

Enable database support:

    
    
    cd src
    make setdb
    Error: PostgreSQL client libraries not installed.
    
    Info: Compiled with MySQL support.
    

If you want postgres support, install `postgresql-server-dev-9.3`.

Continue with the compilation/installation:

    
    
    cd ../
    ./install.sh

     - System is Debian (Ubuntu or derivative).
     - Init script modified to start OSSEC HIDS during boot.
    
     - Configuration finished properly.
    
     - To start OSSEC HIDS:
            /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control start
    
     - To stop OSSEC HIDS:
            /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control stop
    
     - The configuration can be viewed or modified at /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
    
    
        Thanks for using the OSSEC HIDS.
        If you have any question, suggestion or if you find any bug,
        contact us at contact@ossec.net or using our public maillist at
        ossec-list@ossec.net
        ( http://www.ossec.net/main/support/ ).
    
        More information can be found at http://www.ossec.net
    
        ---  Press ENTER to finish (maybe more information below). ---
    
     - In order to connect agent and server, you need to add each agent to the server.
       Run the 'manage_agents' to add or remove them:
    
       /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents
    
       More information at: 
       http://www.ossec.net/en/manual.html#ma
    

OSSEC is now installed. Restart it:

    
    
    /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart
    

### Configuring MySQL

We need to create a user and database for OSSEC. Open a MySQL shell:

    
    
    mysql -u root -p
    Enter password:
    [...]
    
    mysql> create database ossec;
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
    
    grant INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE,CREATE,DELETE,EXECUTE on ossec.* to ossec_u;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
    
    set password for ossec_u = PASSWORD('Passw0rd');
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
    
    flush privileges;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
    
    quit;
    

The database also needs a schema. OSSEC provides the schema, it is located in
the extracted OSSEC folder, `src/os_dbd`.

Import it into MySQL:

    
    
    mysql -u root -p ossec < src/os_dbd/mysql.schema
    

### OSSEC MySQL configuration

We have to add the database config to `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`:

    
    
    <ossec_config>
        <database_output>
            <hostname>127.0.0.1</hostname>
            <username>ossec_u</username>
            <password>Passw0rd</password>
            <database>ossec</database>
            <type>mysql</type>
        </database_output>
    </ossec_config>
    

Change `type mysql` to `type postgresql` for the PostgreSQL database.

Save it, then enable the database in OSSEC:

    
    
    /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control enable database
    /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart 
    

### Installing OSSEC Web UI

[![OSSEC Web UI][6]][6]

This is also quite simple. Because we've already set up Apache and PHP, we can
just download the web UI and extract to `/var/www/html`:

    
    
    wget http://www.ossec.net/files/ossec-wui-0.8.tar.gz
    tar -xf ossec-wui-0.8.tar.gz
    mkdir -p /var/www/html/ossec/tmp/
    mv ossec-wui-0.8/* /var/www/html/ossec/
    chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/ossec/tmp/
    chmod 666 /var/www/html/ossec/tmp
    

Make sure the `www-data` user can access the ossec folder:

    
    
    usermod -a -G ossec www-data
    

We use version 0.8 of Web UI because there are a lot of errors (like broken
search) in the stable 0.3 version. We also set the correct permissions on the
`tmp/` folder. Afterwards the web ui is visible at `http://hostname/ossec/`.

### Installing Analogi Web Dashboard

[![OSSEC Analogi dashboard][4]][4]

[This tutorial was tested on a DigitalOcean VPS. If you use this link you
sponsor this website. (referral link)][1]

The Analogi dashboard is a nice and informative dashboard around OSSEC, which
provides more visual information then the standard Web UI. The standard Web UI
has better search functions, the Dashboard can be used for example on a Wall
Mounted monitor and such.

Installation consists out of cloning the git repo and editing the settings file:

    
    
    cd /var/www/html/
    git clone https://github.com/ECSC/analogi.git
    cp analogi/db_ossec.php.new analogi/db_ossec.php
    vim analogi/db_ossec.php        
    

Edit the relevant settings for the MySQL database configuration:

    
    
    define ('DB_USER_O', 'ossec_u');
    define ('DB_PASSWORD_O', 'Passw0rd');
    define ('DB_HOST_O', '127.0.0.1');
    define ('DB_NAME_O', 'ossec');
    

When correctly configured the Analogi webinterface can be found at
http://hostname/analogi/.

The OSSEC server is now correctly set up.

### Client installation

Download and verify the OSSEC 2.8 .tar.gz file as described above. Don't forget
to install the development packages. This time, do an agent installation. See
the output below:

    
    
    # ./install.sh

#### Client OSSEC config

Adding a client to OSSEC is quite simple. First you add the client to the
server, which gives you a key. Then you add this key to the client, edit the
config file on the client and that's it.

First we need to generate a key on the OSSEC server for this client. We do this
by running `/var/ossec/bin/manage_agents`, option A, then entering the hostname,
IP and ID for the client we want to add. Do this on the OSSEC server:

    
    
    root@ossec:~# /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents
    ****************************************
    * OSSEC HIDS v2.8 Agent manager.     *
    * The following options are available: *
    ****************************************
       (A)dd an agent (A).
       (E)xtract key for an agent (E).
       (L)ist already added agents (L).
       (R)emove an agent (R).
       (Q)uit.
    Choose your action: A,E,L,R or Q: A
    
    - Adding a new agent (use '\q' to return to the main menu).
      Please provide the following:
       * A name for the new agent: ossec-client1
       * The IP Address of the new agent: 2.3.4.5
       * An ID for the new agent[001]: 
    Agent information:
       ID:001
       Name:ossec-client1
       IP Address:2.3.4.5
    
    Confirm adding it?(y/n): y
    Agent added.
    

Get the key for the OSSEC client:

    
    
    root@ossec:~# /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents
    
    ****************************************
    * OSSEC HIDS v2.8 Agent manager.     *
    * The following options are available: *
    ****************************************
       (A)dd an agent (A).
       (E)xtract key for an agent (E).
       (L)ist already added agents (L).
       (R)emove an agent (R).
       (Q)uit.
    Choose your action: A,E,L,R or Q: E
    
    Available agents:
       ID: 001, Name: ossec-client1, IP: 2.3.4.5
    Provide the ID of the agent to extract the key (or '\q' to quit): 001
    
    Agent key information for '001' is:
    SD[...]AAUjd=
    
    ** Press ENTER to return to the main menu.
    

Then switch to the OSSEC client and execute the manage_agents:

    
    
    root@ossec:~# /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents
    
    ****************************************
    * OSSEC HIDS v2.8 Agent manager.     *
    * The following options are available: *
    ****************************************
       (I)mport key from the server (I).
       (Q)uit.
    Choose your action: I or Q: i
    
    * Provide the Key generated by the server.
    * The best approach is to cut and paste it.
    *** OBS: Do not include spaces or new lines.
    
    Paste it here (or '\q' to quit): SD[...]AAUjd=
    
    Agent information:
       ID:001
       Name:ossec-client1
       IP Address:2.3.4.5
    
    Confirm adding it?(y/n): y
    Added.
    ** Press ENTER to return to the main menu.
    

Check if this in the `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file:

    
    
    <client>
      <server-hostname>1.2.3.4</server-hostname>
    </client>
    

Where `1.2.3.4` is your OSSEC server URL or IP.

Now restart OSSEC on both the OSSEC server and the newly added client:

    
    
    /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart
    

Repeat these steps for any client that needs to be added.

### Bonus Tips

Here are a few bonus tips/config examples for OSSEC

### Active Response

If you've enabled Active Response you are protected from brute force attacks for
ssh and some other pieces of software. Try it, login as a nonexistent user and
check the web ui and logging:

[![brute][7]][7]

    
    
    tail -f /var/ossec/logs/active-responses.log 
    Wed Jun 11 21:16:43 CEST 2014 /var/ossec/active-response/bin/host-deny.sh add - 198.211.118.121 1402514203.20760 5712
    Wed Jun 11 21:16:43 CEST 2014 /var/ossec/active-response/bin/firewall-drop.sh add - 198.211.118.121 1402514203.20760 5712
    

On Linux it is just a standard iptables DROP rule for that IP. You can delete
the DROP rule by first finding out it's ID:

    
    
    iptables -L -n --line-numbers
    Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
    num  target     prot opt source               destination         
    1    DROP       all  --  198.211.118.121      0.0.0.0/0           
    
    Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
    num  target     prot opt source               destination         
    1    DROP       all  --  198.211.118.121      0.0.0.0/0           
    
    Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
    num  target     prot opt source               destination
    

Then you can delete the rule with that ID:

    
    
    iptables -D INPUT 1
    iptables -D FORWARD 1
    

#### Ignoring rules

To very simply ignore rules based on rule id, add them to the XML file located
in `/var/ossec/rules/local_rules/xml`, either on the ossec client for one
machine or the ossec server to ignore on all machines:

    
    
    <!-- Specify here a list of rules to ignore. -->
    <!-- 3334 postfix start  -->
    <!-- 3333 postfix stop -->
    <rule id="100030" level="0">
        <if_sid>3333, 3334</if_sid>
        <description>List of rules to be ignored.</description>
    </rule>
    

#### Monitoring additional log files

The OSSEC agent by default only monitors a few log files. To add more, edit the
`/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file and add a line like this:

    
    
    <localfile>
        <location>/var/log/*</location>
        <log_format>syslog</log_format>
    </localfile>
    

This will add all files under `/var/log`. This might be a lot, you can also just
add multiple `<localfile>` blocks with filenames.

#### Firewall

You need to allow UDP port 1514 between OSSEC server and clients. Otherwise you
get errors like this:

    
    
    2013/09/06 19:53:00 ossec-agentd: INFO: Using IPv4 for: 10.0.51.31 .
    2013/09/06 19:53:21 ossec-agentd(4101): WARN: Waiting for server reply (not started). Tried: 'ossec.raymii.nl/10.0.51.31'.
