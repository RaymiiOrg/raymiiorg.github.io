Sometimes you do strange stuff with your Linux PC.  
I did yesterday, when I was experimenting with what would happen if I would
chmod /usr/bin/chmod to 000. That gave me some problems. Solution from: [Linux
Magazine][1]

If the CHMOD program is not executable anymore, you should start it via the
linker.

Execute this command:

    
    
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 /bin/chmod 755 /bin/chmod 
    

This also works for other programs, just as long you know the original path to
it...

Edit: 777 edited to 755,  
Here is another solution thanks to: [ Rainer Weikusat][3]

    
    
    perl -e 'chmod(0755, "/bin/chmod")'
