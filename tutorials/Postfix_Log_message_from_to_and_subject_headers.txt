This is a little trick for Postfix, it lets you log the `subject`, `from` and
`to` of all the emails postfix sends (or which pass through it if you run it as
a relay). It comes in handy when you need to debug an email issue and need to
confirm your mailserver has sent the message.

First create the file `/etc/postfix/header_checks` and insert this into it:

    
    
    /^subject:/      WARN
    /^to:/           WARN
    /^from:/         WARN
    /^Subject:/      WARN
    /^To:/           WARN
    /^From:/         WARN
    

Now, in your postfix `/etc/postfix/main.cf` add the following to the end of the
file:

    
    
    header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks
    

And restart postfix:

    
    
    service postfix restart
    

You will hopefully now get log items like below, and if not you have a problem
with your mailserver:

    
    
    Dec  4 08:23:05 localhost postfix/cleanup[2278]: 90CA714: warning: header
    Subject: This is a testmail which gets logged from localhost[127.0.0.1];
    from=<root@localhost> to=<root@localhost> proto=ESMTP helo=<localhost>
