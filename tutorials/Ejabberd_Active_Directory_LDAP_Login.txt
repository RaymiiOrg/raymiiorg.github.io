This tutorial shows you how to set up `ejabberd` to authenticate against a
Microsoft Active Directory LDAP. It is tested with an mixed Server 2008 / Server
2012 Active Directory, and ejabberd 2.1.10 running on Debian 7 and Ubuntu 12.04.

[If you need to set up an ejabberd server then you can read my tutorial here how
to do that][2].

This tutorial assumes a working ejabberd installation and a working Active
Directory installation.

Edit the `/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg` file and change the `auth_method` from
internal to LDAP, and use the following example settings:

    
    
    {host_config, "example.org", [{auth_method, ldap},
    {ldap_servers, ["pdc.example.org", "dc2.example.org", "dc3.example.org"]},
    {ldap_encrypt, none},
    {ldap_port, 389},
    {ldap_uids, [{"sAMAccountName", "%u"}]},
    {ldap_base, "cn=Users,dc=Example,dc=org"},
    {ldap_rootdn, "EXAMPLE\\ejabberd-ldap-account"},
    {ldap_password, "HAc4glzWnhhMHSMEJTUq"}]}.
    {acl, admin, {user, "adminUser", "example.org"}}.
    {acl, admin, {user, "remy", "example.org"}}.
    

As you can see I use the "Example.org" Active Directory domain with three LDAP
AD Domain Controllers and with a special ejabberd LDAP bind account. This can be
a normal account, but please create a separate one so that if the config of
ejabberd gets compromised you only have to change one password at one place.

After setting up the config give ejabberd a restart:

    
    
    /etc/init.d/ejabberd restart
    

And you are all set to go. If you use a clustered setup make sure you set this
configuration on all the nodes.
