This tutorial shows you how to install extra software in the VMWare vCenter
appliance. VMWare provides a vCenter appliance, which is a SUSE Linux Enterprise
Server appliance with the VMWare vCenter server software installed. Because this
is SUSE, we can add repositories and install software from there. By default it
comes without repositories enabled. I needed to do this because I want to use
NRPE on the vCenter appliance.

Make sure you can SSH to your vCenter Appliance. I use my own account with sudo,
however, if you're feeling lucky you might be able to use the root account.
Remember, to disable root login.

First we need to make sure we have the correct version. Check the file `/etc
/SuSE-release`:

    
    
    SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (x86_64)
    VERSION = 11
    PATCHLEVEL = 2
    

I use the vCenter 5.5 appliance. If you have another version, change the
repository URL to match this version.

Add the openSUSE repository:

    
    
    zypper addrepo -f http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/11.2/repo/oss/ opensuse
    

Output:

    
    
    Adding repository 'opensuse' [done]
    Repository 'opensuse' successfully added
    Enabled: Yes
    Autorefresh: Yes
    GPG check: Yes
    URI: http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/11.2/repo/oss/
    

Verify that adding the repository went successfully:

    
    
    zypper repos -d
    

Output:

    
    
    # | Alias    | Name     | Enabled | Refresh | Priority | Type | URI                                                      | Service
    --+----------+----------+---------+---------+----------+------+----------------------------------------------------------+--------
    1 | opensuse | opensuse | Yes     | Yes     |   99     | NONE | http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/11.2/repo/oss/ |
    

Update the local repository cache (comparable to `apt-get update`):

    
    
    zypper refresh
    

It will ask you if you want to trust the repository:

    
    
    Retrieving repository 'opensuse' metadata [\]
    
    New repository or package signing key received:
    Key ID: B88B2FD43DBDC284
    Key Name: openSUSE Project Signing Key <opensuse@opensuse.org>
    Key Fingerprint: 22C07BA534178CD02EFE22AAB88B2FD43DBDC284
    Key Created: Fri Nov  7 14:10:07 2008
    Key Expires: Sun Nov  7 14:10:07 2010 (EXPIRED)
    Repository: opensuse
    
    Do you want to reject the key, trust temporarily, or trust always? [r/t/a/?] (r): 
    

Answer with `a` to always trust this repository:

    
    
    Retrieving repository 'opensuse' metadata [done]
    Building repository 'opensuse' cache [done]
    All repositories have been refreshed.
    

That's it. If you now for example want to install NRPE, you can use the
following commands. First search for the correct package name:

    
    
    zypper search nrpe
    

Output:

    
    
    Loading repository data...
    Reading installed packages...
    
    S | Name               | Summary                                               | Type
    --+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+--------
      | nagios-nrpe        | Nagios Remote Plug-In Executor                        | package
      | nagios-nrpe-client | Client part of Nagios Remote Plug-ins Executor (NRPE) | package
      | nagios-nrpe-doc    | Nagios Remote Plug-In Executor documentation          | package
      | nagios-nrpe-server | Server part for Nagios Remote Plug-In Executor        | package
    

Install the correct one:

    
    
    zypper install nagios-nrpe-client
    

Output:
