DokuWiki is a standards compliant, simple to use Wiki, mainly aimed at creating
documentation of any kind. It is targeted at developer teams, workgroups and
small companies. It has a simple but powerful syntax which makes sure the
datafiles remain readable outside the Wiki and eases the creation of structured
texts. All data is stored in plain text files no database is required.

#### Key features of DokuWiki

##### Revision control

DokuWiki stores all versions of each wiki page, allowing the user to compare the
current version with any older version. The difference engine is the same as the
one used in MediaWiki. Parallel editing of one page by multiple users is
prevented by a locking mechanism.

##### Access control

Access control can be handled by a user manager which allows users and groups of
users to be defined, and an access control list where an admin user can define
permissions on page and namespace level, giving it much better access control
than Mediawiki.

##### Plugins

DokuWiki has a generic plugin interface which simplifies the process of writing
and maintaining plugins. There are over 750 plugins available. These can be
easily integrated and managed by an admin user with the help of the plugin
manager.

##### Templates

The appearance of the wiki can be defined by a template. There are templates to
make it resemble a MediaWiki site, or a popular blogging platform and more.

##### Internationalization and localization

DokuWiki supports Unicode (UTF-8), so languages such as Chinese, Thai, and
Hebrew can be displayed. DokuWiki can be configured in about 40 languages.

##### Caching

DokuWiki stores the rendered output of parsed wiki pages to reduce server load.

##### Full text search

DokuWiki has an integrated indexed search with which a user can search for
keywords on the wiki.

#### Other very handy and interesting features

  * Content can be categorized in namespaces, easily browsable through an automatic index
  * Uploading and embedding of images and other media (images, PDF, music or anything)
  * Unlimited page revisions
  * Overview of Recent changes
  * Colored side by side diff support
  * Section Editing allows editing of small parts of a page (a feature I use very much)
  * Authentication Backends for integrating with LDAP, MySQL, Postgres and others 

#### Syntax

Below I'll give some examples of the Dokuwiki Syntaxis.

[Official Syntax Reference can be found here][3]

[Here is a good page with Tips and Tricks for DokuWiki][4]

##### Headers

    
    
    ====== This is H1 ======
    ===== This is H2 =====
    ==== This is H3 ====
    === This is H4 ===
    == This is H5 ==
    

##### Unordered Lists

Type two spaces and then a star: `*`

    
    
      * first
      * second
        * sub-list
        * sub-item 2
      * third
    

##### Ordered Lists

Type two spaces and then a dash: `-`

    
    
      - first ordered
      - second ordered
        - first sub-ordered
      - third item
    

##### Quotes

    
    
    I say this
    &gt; I agree with that
    &gt;&gt; Well, I do not.
    &gt; Why not?
    Yeah, why not?
    

##### Images

    
    
    Real size:                        {{wiki:dokuwiki-128.png}}
    Resize to given width:            {{wiki:dokuwiki-128.png?50}}
    Resize to given width and height: {{wiki:dokuwiki-128.png?200x50}}
    Resized external image:           {{http://de3.php.net/images/php.gif?200x50}}
    

Alignment via left or right whitespaces (or both for center):

    
    
    {{ wiki:dokuwiki-128.png}}
    {{wiki:dokuwiki-128.png }}
    {{ wiki:dokuwiki-128.png }}
    

##### Horizontal Lines
