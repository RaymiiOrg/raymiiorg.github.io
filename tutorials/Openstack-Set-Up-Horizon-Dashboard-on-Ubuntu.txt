This is a guide on installing the Openstack Horizon dashboard on Ubuntu 12.04 or
14.04, including SSL setup. It features nice screenshots and even an Ansible
playbook to automate it all. We will set up the Icehouse version of Horizon.

Openstack is one of those cloudy cloud projects. Warning, keep your buzzword
bingo cards ready for the [Wikipedia][3] definition:

    
    
    OpenStack is a free and open-source software cloud computing platform. It is primarily deployed as an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) solution. The technology consists of a series of interrelated projects that control pools of processing, storage, and networking resources throughout a data center, able to be managed or provisioned through a web-based dashboard, command-line tools, or a RESTful API. It is released under the terms of the Apache License.
    

This tutorial does not cover a full openstack cluster setup, just the Dashboard.
In this tutorial my Dashboard talks to the [CloudVPS][4] Openstack service,
change this for your own Openstack installation.

You can see all my [Openstack related tutorials here][5]. For example, how to
use [Duplicity to create Encrypted backups to the Openstack Swift Object
Store][6].

### Requirements

  * Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.04 machine
  * An Openstack cluster with at least: 
    * compute (kvm)
    * keystone (identity)
    * glance (images)
    * cinder (block storage)
    * neutron/classic networking

Just swift (object store) and keystone are also OK, just to manage Object
storage.

I'll be using the [CloudVPS][4] public Openstack cloud in this example.

If you order a VPS or Objectstore at [CloudVPS][4], please mention my name or
this article. I'll get a little referal bonus, which will be used to keep this
awesome website running.

Note that this article is not sponsored nor endorsed by [CloudVPS][4], nor am I
speaking for or as [CloudVPS][4].

### Install packages

Because Ubuntu 14.04 has Cloudy Support (as in, Openstack Icehouse in the main
repo) we can just install it. First update the system:

    
    
    apt-get update
    

Then install the packages required:

    
    
    apt-get install -y apache2 memcached libapache2-mod-wsgi openstack-dashboard
    

Remove the ubuntu dashboard theme, this prevents the network map, translations
and some menu's from working:

    
    
    apt-get remove -y --purge openstack-dashboard-ubuntu-theme
    

Here's a picture of Horizon with the Ubuntu theme:

![openstack][8]

If you run 12.04 you should add the Icehouse Openstack repository first:

    
    
    apt-get install python-software-properties
    add-apt-repository cloud-archive:icehouse
    apt-get update
    

If you only want the dashboard you don't need the backported kernel on 12.04.
Otherwise, install the following extra packages: `linux-image-generic-lts-saucy
linux-headers-generic-lts-saucy` and reboot.

### Configure Apache

Make sure the Horizon dashboard config is enabled:

    
    
    a2enconf openstack-dashboard
    

On 12.04 this is not needed. The config is already enabled there in
`/etc/apache2/conf.d/`.

Enable HTTPS:

    
    
    a2ensite default-ssl
    a2enmod ssl
    

If you want to redirect all traffic from HTTP to HTTPS, which you should, enable
`mod_rewrite`:

    
    
    a2enmod rewrite
    

Edit `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf`:

    
    
    vim /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
    

On 12.04 the file is named without `.conf`:

    
    
    vim /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
    

And add the following:

    
    
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
    RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}
    

Somewhere in the `<Virtualhost>` part.

Make sure to set up a correct certificate if you are going to run HTTPS in
production. If you need tips to [Set up strong SSL security on Apache, see my
tutorial][9].

Don't forget to restart Apache:

    
    
    service apache2 restart
    

### Configure Horizon

Edit the dashboard config:

    
    
    vim /etc/openstack-dashboard/local_settings.py
    

Add the following if you are using SSL:

    
    
    CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
    USE_SSL = True
    

Configure the Openstack host by setting the following variables:

    
    
    OPENSTACK_HOST = "127.0.0.1"
    OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_URL = "http://%s:5000/v2.0" % OPENSTACK_HOST
    OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_DEFAULT_ROLE = "_member_"
    

I'm using [CloudVPS][4]'s Openstack service, so for me the variables are like
this:

    
    
    OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_URL = "https://identity.stack.cloudvps.com/v2.0"
    

Thats it. Visit the Dasboard at `http://$IPADDRESS/horizon` and login.

Here's another screenshot showing the Swift (Object Storage) part of Horizon:

### Ansible Playbook

I've also written an simple Ansible playbook to install a Horizon instance. You
can find it in this [Github repository.][11]
