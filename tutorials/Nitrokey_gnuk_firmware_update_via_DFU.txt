The Nitrokey (start) can be upgraded to a newer GNUK firmware. However, this can
only be done via ST Link or DFU, if you use the Gnuk USB firmware upgrade you
will brick the device. This guide shows you how to attach a DFU adapter and how
to flash firmware to a Nitrokey, both for upgrading or unbricking an USB
upgraded one.

You need to build the `gnuk` firmware. The Device ID needs to be changed to
`20a0:4211` in the file `gnuk/USB_DEBVICE_ID`:

    
    
    $ cat GNUK_USB_DEVICE_ID 
    # VID:PID bcdDev  Product_STRING  Vendor_STRING
    234b:0000 0200  Gnuk Token  Free Software Initiative of Japan
    20a0:4211 0200  Nitrokey
    ##########<TAB> ##<TAB> ##########<TAB> #################
    

For the `gnuk` firmware compilation, please see [this article][2]. I will not
cover that here any further.

### Requirements and connection

You do need the following:

  * USB header ([like this][3], I hot-aired one of an old motherboard)
  * Small bridge wire
  * USB to RS-232 serial adapter ([like this][4])
  * Small wires
  * Caseless Nitrokey (note that you probably will break the case).

## \- [stm32flash][5]

DFU is a simple protocol via serial port which allows programming but no
debugging. On the Nitrokey hardware the appropriate pins are exposed over the
USB connector.

Connect the wires from the USB serial adapter to the USB header (Nitrokey USB
Plug <-> Serial/TTL adapter):

  * Pin 1, VCC <-> VCC (5v)
  * Pin 2, D- <-> TX
  * Pin 3, D+ <-> RX
  * Pin 4, GND <-> GND

This diagram represents the pinout of the USB socket:

    
    
      ################### 
      #                 # 
      # ############### # 
      #                 # 
      #                 # 
      ################### 
         #   #   #   #   
         #   #   #   #    
    
         1   2   3   4
    

(This nice ascii art comes from the [Nitrokey Pro Hardware][6] repo.)

You also need a small wire to bridge the two holes before you attach the
Nitrokey so that it boots into DFU mode.

Here is a picture of my setup:

This was my complete workspace:

### Unblocking the flash

The STM32 controller has a flash-protection bit which prohibits writing to the
flash. The `stm32flash` tool says it's able to unblock that, but for the
Nitrokey this fails:

    
    
    sudo stm32flash -u /dev/ttyUSB0 
    

Output:

    
    
    stm32flash 0.5
    
    http://stm32flash.sourceforge.net/
    
    Interface serial_posix: 57600 8E1
    Version      : 0x22
    Option 1     : 0x00
    Option 2     : 0x00
    Device ID    : 0x0410 (STM32F10xxx Medium-density)
    - RAM        : 20KiB  (512b reserved by bootloader)
    - Flash      : 128KiB (size first sector: 4x1024)
    - Option RAM : 16b
    - System RAM : 2KiB
    Write-unprotecting flash
    Got NACK from device on command 0x73
    Done.
    

So sadly I have to use Windows software, the [ST Demo Loader][9]. Download and
install it and connect the DFU-Nitrokey to the Windows machine.

**Update**

[This post][10] on the mailinglist states that you could use the `-k` flag with
`stm32flash` to remove the `read` protection as well. It also states to not
forget to use the `-j` to read-protect the Nitrokey again after you're done
flashing if you intend to put real keys on there.

I tested this and it works, so you don't need the Windows tool in the end.
Scroll down for the Linux/`stm32flash` way.

**End update**

Also copy the compiled GNUK binary (`gnuk/src/build/gnuk.bin`) to the Windows
machine.

### Flashing via Windows

Start the utility up and select the correct COM port (COM4 for me):

![][11]

If the protection is set the tool will show a red traffic light and a `Remove
Protection` button. Click and complete that, then click next:

![][12]

Click Next:

![][13]

Select `Download to device`, `Erase the necessary pages` and choose the
`gnuk.bin` file:

![][14]

It will erase the flash:

![][15]

Then upload the firmware:

![][16]

It will complete with a nice green bar:

![][17]

Now the binary is flashed and your Nitrokey should work. In my case, it
sucessfully worked with gnuk 1.2:

### Flashing via Linux

First remote the read protection bit from the device (Device should be in
bootloader mode with the wire bridge for all these actions):

    
    
    sudo stm32flash -k /dev/ttyUSB0 
    

Output:

    
    
    stm32flash 0.5
    
    http://stm32flash.sourceforge.net/
    
    Interface serial_posix: 57600 8E1
    Version      : 0x22
    Option 1     : 0x00
    Option 2     : 0x00
    Device ID    : 0x0410 (STM32F10xxx Medium-density)
    - RAM        : 20KiB  (512b reserved by bootloader)
    - Flash      : 128KiB (size first sector: 4x1024)
    - Option RAM : 16b
    - System RAM : 2KiB
    Read-UnProtecting flash
    Done.
    

Flash the binary and start it up after the flash:

    
    
    sudo stm32flash -w build/gnuk.bin -g 0x0 /dev/ttyUSB0 
    

Output:

    
    
    stm32flash 0.5
    
    http://stm32flash.sourceforge.net/
    
    Using Parser : Raw BINARY
    Interface serial_posix: 57600 8E1
    Version      : 0x22
    Option 1     : 0x00
    Option 2     : 0x00
    Device ID    : 0x0410 (STM32F10xxx Medium-density)
    - RAM        : 20KiB  (512b reserved by bootloader)
    - Flash      : 128KiB (size first sector: 4x1024)
    - Option RAM : 16b
    - System RAM : 2KiB
    Write to memory
    Erasing memory
    Wrote address 0x0801b000 (100.00%) Done.
    
    Starting execution at address 0x08000000... done.
    

Do set the `read protection` back on after flashing, otherwise your keys might
be exposed:

    
    
    sudo stm32flash -j /dev/ttyUSB0 
    

Output:

    
    
    stm32flash 0.5
    
    http://stm32flash.sourceforge.net/
    
    Interface serial_posix: 57600 8E1
    Version      : 0x22
    Option 1     : 0x00
    Option 2     : 0x00
    Device ID    : 0x0410 (STM32F10xxx Medium-density)
    - RAM        : 20KiB  (512b reserved by bootloader)
    - Flash      : 128KiB (size first sector: 4x1024)
    - Option RAM : 16b
    - System RAM : 2KiB
    Read-Protecting flash
    Done.
    

### NeuG on the Nitrokey Start

I did try to flash NeuG to the device, but that resulted in a blinking green LED
and nothing else. Here's the command for reference.

    
    
    sudo stm32flash -w ../../neug/src/build/neug.bin -g 0x0 /dev/ttyUSB0 
    

Output:

    
    
    stm32flash 0.5
    
    http://stm32flash.sourceforge.net/
    
    Using Parser : Raw BINARY
    Interface serial_posix: 57600 8E1
    Version      : 0x22
    Option 1     : 0x00
    Option 2     : 0x00
    Device ID    : 0x0410 (STM32F10xxx Medium-density)
    - RAM        : 20KiB  (512b reserved by bootloader)
    - Flash      : 128KiB (size first sector: 4x1024)
    - Option RAM : 16b
    - System RAM : 2KiB
    Write to memory
    Erasing memory
    Wrote address 0x08005c24 (100.00%) Done.
    
    Starting execution at address 0x08000000... done.
    

NeuG does work on the FST-01.
