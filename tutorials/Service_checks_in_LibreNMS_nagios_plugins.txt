LibreNMS is becoming one of my favorite monitoring tools. Setup and getting
started is easy and it has enough advanced options and tunables. I recently
discovered that LibreNMS is able to check services as well. Services, in this
context, means, executing Nagios plugins (like check _http, check_ ping, etc).
This allows you to check services that SNMP does not cover by default, like
HTTP(s) health checks, certificate expiry, tcp port checks (e.g. rdp) and
anything for which you can write a Nagios plugin yourself. The performance data,
if available, is graphed automatically. Alerting is done with the regular
LibreNMS alerts. This guide covers the setup of services (it's not enabled by
default) and a few basic checks, like an http health check, certificate expiry
and SSH monitoring.

You need a LibreNMS server for this guide to work. The project provides
excellent documentation. To get started, get a [Digital Ocean VPS][1] and follow
the [official guide for Ubuntu][2].

### Nagios check plugins

For those unfamiliar with Nagios, it is a monitoring system which can execute
checks. These checks are scripts and progams which take input (for example,
which host to check, tresholds), do a check and then return an exit code and
some performance data. The plugins can be in any language, Nagios only cares
about the exit codes. They can be the following:

  * 0: OK
  * 1: WARNING
  * 2: CRITICAL
  * 3: OK
  * 4 and up: UNKNOWN

For example, to check if a website is working, you would use the `check_http`
plugin. This plugin checks if the site returns a `200 OK` and if so, gives exit
status `0`. If not, for example because of a timeout, access denied or `50x
error`, it will return status `1` or `2`. Nagios then can do all kinds of
alerting based on those statusses.

Performance data is comma seperated value data added after the status output in
the command result. This can be anything, for example, the time the HTTP request
took.

Since you can write these scripts yourself any monitoring system that uses these
plugins is very extensible. It can check anything you want as long as you can
write a script for it. This makes the monitoring tool very powerfull, you're not
limited to what they provide.

To read more about monitoring, [you can read one of my other articles][3].

### Enabling service checks

Service checks are not enabled by default in LibreNMS. [The documentation][4]
explains how to enable the module. In this guide I asume your path is
`/opt/librenms/`. Edit your config file:

    
    
    vim /opt/librenms/config.php
    

Add the following line:

    
    
    $config['show_services']           = 1;
    

Save the file.

Edit the LibreNMS cronjob to include service checks:

    
    
    vim /etc/cron.d/librenms
    

Add:

    
    
    */5  *    * * *   librenms    /opt/librenms/services-wrapper.py 1
    

Make sure the Nagios plugins are installed:

    
    
    apt-get install nagios-plugins nagios-plugins-extra
    

Do a test to see if the plugins work:

    
    
    /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_http -H raymii.org -S -p 443 
    

Example output:

    
    
    HTTP OK: HTTP/1.1 200 OK - 1320 bytes in 0.199 second response time |time=0.198748s;;;0.000000 size=1320B;;;0   
    

#### Adding a (dummy) host

You must have a host in LibreNMS to be able to add service checks. Normally you
would use `snmp` to monitor devices, but if you just want to do simple (HTTP)
checks without SNMP you can add a host without SNMP or TCP checks. Via
`Devices`, `Add Device` you can enter an URL/IP. Uncheck the SNMP checkbox and
check the `Force add` button:

![][5]

If this device does not accept ICMP (ping) traffic, you can disable that as
well. Go to the device, select the Cog menu, Edit, "Misc" tab, then check
"Disable ICMP Test?":

![][6]

If you do want to use SNMP, here is a quick guide for Ubuntu. First install
`snmpd`:

    
    
    apt-get install snmpd
    

Edit the configuration. Remove everything and add the following:

    
    
    agentAddress udp:161
    
    createUser <username> SHA "<password>" AES "<password2>" 
    
    view systemonly included .1.3.6.1.2.1.1
    view systemonly included .1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1
    
    rwuser <username>
    
    sysLocation <location>
    sysContact  <your name and email>
    
    includeAllDisks 10%
    
    defaultMonitors         yes
    linkUpDownNotifications yes
    

Change `username` and `password` to a long and secure name and password (8
characters minimum). Restart snmpd:

    
    
    service snmpd restart
    

**Add a rule in your firewall to only allow access to UDP port 161 from your
monitoring service and deny all other traffic.**

You can now add this machine in LibreNMS using SNMPv3 and the authentication
data you provided.

### Configuring services in LibreNMS

In LibreNMS you should now have a new tab button in the top menu, named
"Services":

![][7]

Make sure you added a host as described above. You can navigate to a host and
click the "Services" tab, then click "Add service". In the top menu bar you can
also click "Services", "Add Service". You then have to select the host as well.

The `type` is the nagios plugin you want to use. In our case, `http` (the
`check_` part is not shown).

Enter a meaningfull description. For example, "HTTP Check
https://example.org/path/to/data".

The IP address can be the hostname or the IP. It is recommended to make this the
same as the host the services are coupled to.

The "Parameters" are the Nagios check command parameters, from the shell. In the
case of an HTTP check for one of the servers hosting raymii.org it would be:

    
    
    -E -I 80.211.96.38 -S -p 443 -u "/s/index.html"
    

  * `IP Address`: raymii.org
  * `-E`: extended performance data
  * `-I 80.211.96.38`: the specifc IP address (optional, I have multiple A records)
  * `-S`: use SSL
  * `-p 443`: use port 443
  * `-u "/s/index.html"`: the URL to request. (optional)

![][8]

All parameters can be found on the [monitoring-plugins][9] website. You can test
on the shell first before you add the check to LibreNMS.

Save the dialog box and wait a few minutes for the check to run.

An SSH check is even simpler, just select `SSH` as the type and add the check.
Here is an example of a Cisco switch where SSH is checked:

![][10]

A certificate check, to get an alert when a certificate is about to expire, can
also be done. The `type` is `http` and the parameters are:

    
    
    --sni -S -p 443 -C 30
    

It will check if the certificate expires within 30 days.

#### Alerting

There is a default alert rule in LibreNMS named `Service up/down`:

    
    
    services.service_status != 0 AND macros.device_up = 1
    

If you want to differentiate between WARNING and CRITICAL Nagios alerts, you can
create two rules:

    
    
    # warning
    services.service_status = 1 AND macros.device_up = 1
    
    
    # critical
    services.service_status = 2 AND macros.device_up = 1
    

### Limits

Specific alerting and rechecking when a check fails is not as configurable in
Icinga or Nagios. The check will run, and alert you on a failure. Icinga/Nagios
allow you to configure escalation paths and advanced re-checking. For example,
when a check fails, recheck it 4 times with an interval of X seconds (instead of
the regular check interval) and only alert if it still fails.

In Icinga you can define (service or host) groups and apply service checks to
these groups. LibreNMS doesn't allow this, so you cannot define a check and
apply it to a group. If you need to check 100 servers, it means defining 100
checks by hand per server.

### Examples

Here is an example of services that are down:

![][11]

Here is an example of a dummy host (no ICMP or SNMP) with a HTTP check and
alerting enabled:
