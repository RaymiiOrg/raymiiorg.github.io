Keepalived supports running scripts on VRRP state change. This can come in handy
when you need to execute an action when a failover occurs. In my case, I have a
VPN running on a Virtual IP and want to make sure the VPN only runs on the node
with the Virtual IP.

If you want to set up a simple keepalived cluster, see [my tutorial on that][2].

The VPN uses `strongswan` and is a simple ipsec site to site VPN. The two nodes
are datacenter redundant. The nodes function as NAT/firewall proxies for a
backend network. The backend servers need access to some other servers only
reachable over the VPN.

A notify script can be used to take actions, not only removing or adding an IP
to an interface. It can for example start or stop a daemon, depending on the
VRRP state.

It is defined in the keepalived config like this:

    
    
    vrrp_instance Example_VRRP {
        [...]
        notify /usr/local/sbin/notify-keepalived.sh
    }
    

The script can be written in any language as long as it is executable. It
receives the following parameters:

  * $1 = "INSTANCE" or "GROUP"
  * $2 = name of instance or group
  * $3 = target state of transition, "MASTER", "BACKUP" or "FAULT"

This is the bash script I use for the strongswan VPN:

    
    
    #!/bin/bash
    TYPE=$1
    NAME=$2
    STATE=$3
    case $STATE in
            "MASTER") /usr/sbin/service strongswan start
                      ;;
            "BACKUP") /usr/sbin/service strongswan stop
                      ;;
            "FAULT")  /usr/sbin/service strongswan stop
                      exit 0
                      ;;
            *)        /sbin/logger "ipsec unknown state"
                      exit 1
                      ;;
    esac
