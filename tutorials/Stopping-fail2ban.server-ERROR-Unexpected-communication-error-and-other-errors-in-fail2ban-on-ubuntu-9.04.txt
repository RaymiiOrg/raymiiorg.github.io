While running my ssh server with Fail2ban, I decided to take a look in the log
files to see if everything was working. It was not.

Here is the solution to stop errors like: fail2ban.server : ERROR Unexpected
communication error on ubuntu 9.04 with Fail2ban from the repo's.

First we need to install python2.5 because Ubuntu 9.04 has 2.6:

    
    
    sudo apt-get install python2.5
    

Confirm with Y where needed.

Now, we need to edit the fail2ban binary so that it makes use of python2.5:

    
    
    sudo gedit /usr/bin/fail2ban-server
    

Change the first line ( _#!/usr/bin/python_ ) to the following:

    
    
    #!/usr/bin/python2.5
    

Save and close the file.

Now restart the fail2ban service. Note: sudo /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart did
not work for me, so I did the following:

    
    
    sudo /etc/init.d/fail2ban stop
    sudo /etc/init.d/fail2ban start
    

And If you check the log files now ( **vim /var/log/fail2ban.log** ) you will
not see the error anymore.
