'Google Photos' no longer syncs with `Google Drive` or with their `Backup and Sync`
desktop software. There used to be a checkbox to get your `Google Photos` pictures
in `Google Drive` but [that has been disabled][1]. I used that feature together
with their `Backup and Sync` tool to sync all the photos in `Google Photos` to
my local Windows computer. From there I used `DigiKam` to manage the photos
and backup them offline and offsite. Due to Google removing that feature, I had
to go find another way to get the pictures out of `Google Photos`, which, after
a few months of (automated) use, `gphotos-sync` on Ubuntu seems to be the best,
stable choice. In this guide I'll show you how to setup incremental backups 
from `Google Photos` on Ubuntu. My `DigiKam` database moved over without problems,
and now I'm glad I don't have to use Windows for picture managemant anymore.

[gphotos-sync][2] describes itself as:

> Google Photos Sync downloads your Google Photos to the local file system. 
It will backup all the photos the user uploaded to Google Photos, but also 
the album information and additional Google Photos 'Creations' (animations, 
panoramas, movies, effects and collages). It is only for Google Photos download 
/ backup purposes. It cannot upload photos to Google Photos.

### gphotos-sync installation

[gphotos-sync][2] is a command line python application that uses the Google Photos
API. Installation is not very complex since there is a `pip` package. First make 
sure you have `pip` installed:

    apt install python3-pip

Install `gphotos-sync` wih `pip`:

    python3 -m pip install gphotos-sync

Now follows a complex part on getting credentials. It's not as simple as just 
logging in with a username and password.

### Google API authentication setup

The [gphotos-sync manual][2] has an up to date version of these instructions.
At the time of writing this article they were working, but with Google you
can never be sure what happens and when [stuff is deprecated][3].

Start by going to [console.cloud.google.com][4].

Create a new project. Name and location don't matter.

Go to [console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/apis/library][5], select your
new project, then select the `Photos Library API`. Click the big blue Enable 
button.

Go to [console.cloud.google.com/apis][6], select your project and go to 
`OAuth Consent Screen`. Select `External`. 

Fill in a name and click `Save`.

In the menu bar, go to `Credentials`, `Create Credentials`, `OAuth ClientID`.

Select type `Desktop Application` and give the client a name. I used `gp_client`.

You'll see a confirmation screen. Afterwards, use the download arrow button to 
save the file as `client_secret.json`:

![download secrets][7]

I saved it in my `~/Downloads` folder and then moved it to the correct folder for
gphotos-sync, creating it if it does not exist:

    mkdir -p ~/.config/gphotos-sync/
    cp ~/Downloads/client_secret.json ~/.config/gphotos-sync/client_secret.json

Once you login to Google you might get an 'Unverified' warning, which, in this
case, is fine.

After this, rather complex process, you can start using the software.

### gphotos-sync usage

Create a folder where your pictures are going to be synced to:

    mkdir -p ~/gphotos-sync/

Also authorize the client, it will ask you the first time you sync:

    gphotos-sync ~/gphotos-sync/ --progress
    08-23 14:10:31 WARNING  gphotos-sync 2.14.2 2020-08-23 14:10:31.372785 
    Please go here and authorize, https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/[...]
    Paste the response token here:

It will tell you the application is not verified by google, which we know because
we just created it. In this case that is fine. I received a few emails after
logging in from Google as well, which is nice. 

You only need to do that the first time you sync.  

Now, you can just sync with the following command:

    gphotos-sync ~/gphotos-sync/ --progress

Output:

    08-23 14:12:24 WARNING  Indexing Google Photos Files ... 
    08-23 14:13:56 WARNING  Listed 80 items ...
    08-23 14:17:38 WARNING  indexed 100 items ..
    08-23 14:17:38 WARNING  Downloading Photos ... 
    08-23 14:19:07 WARNING  Downloaded 90 items ...

I like to have interactive progress, but you can omit the parameter if you are 
using cron or a script. Logging will be done to a file instead of `STDOUT`.

Your pictures will be in `~/gphotos-sync/photos`.

The next time you sync, only new photos will be downloaded. The tool is not able
to detect changed photos, due to API limitations, so changes will not be detected.
It will also not delete local pictures,
