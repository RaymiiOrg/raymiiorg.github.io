This small tutorial will help you set up iptables to survive a reboot. First you
need to define the rules you want, then continue with this tutorial.

After the rules are defined and tested, execute the following command to save
the rules to `/etc/iptables.conf`

    
    
    iptables-save > /etc/iptables.conf
    

Now edit the `/etc/network/interfaces` file, and add the following right after
the line which looks like `iface eth0 inet static` (eth0 and static might be
different.):

    
    
      pre-up iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.conf
    

Now save the file, and after a reboot the IPtables rules will be in place.
