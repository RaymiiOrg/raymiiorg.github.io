This guide will show you how to convert an OpenVZ (Proxmox) container to a
template. You can then use this template on any other OpenVZ (or proxmox) host.
This can be used either to migrate containers or to create a kind of master
image to deploy new hosts from.

This guide is tested on a proxmox machine running proxmox version 3.2.

Login as root to the proxmox machine via ssh.

Get a list of containers using `vzlist`:

    
    
     CTID      NPROC STATUS    IP_ADDR         HOSTNAME
     100         85 running   10.21.21.5      master.raymii.nl
     101         34 running   10.21.21.6      test-master.raymii.nl
    

I want to create a template of `master.raymii.nl` which has ID 100.

You must stop the container before creating the image:

    
    
    vzctl stop 101
    Stopping container ...
    Container was stopped
    Container is unmounted
    

Go to the container folder:

    
    
    cd /var/lib/vz/private/100
    

Then start the image creation:

    
    
    tar -cvzpf /var/lib/vz/template/cache/master.raymii.nl.tar.gz .
    

This will place the image in
`/var/lib/vz/template/cache/master.raymii.nl.tar.gz`. This file can be copied
and deployed on another host, or used on the same host as a template.
