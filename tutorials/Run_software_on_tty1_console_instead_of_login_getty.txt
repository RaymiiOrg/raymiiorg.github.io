Recently I wanted to change the default login prompt on the `tty1` console on an
OpenStack instance to automatically run `htop`. Instead of logging in via the
console, I wanted it to start up `htop` right away and nothing else. Ubuntu
14.04 uses `init` and Ubuntu 16.04 uses systemd. Both ways are shown in this
tutorial.

Here's what the default login prompt on the console looks:

And here is the result, `htop` running without ever logging in:

Do note that you loose the ability to login via the regular console this way.
`ssh` is your only means of access. Do note that the software is run as root. If
you for example want to run `vim` you also can escape to a shell. `htop` as far
as I know doesn't allow command execution.

On Ubuntu 14.04, edit the following file:

    
    
    vim /etc/init/tty1.conf
    

Replace:

    
    
    exec /sbin/getty -8 38400 tty1
    

with:

    
    
    exec /usr/bin/htop </dev/tty1 >/dev/tty1 2>&1
    

Use full paths and make sure output and input are redirected (`</dev/tty1

> /dev/tty1 2>&1`).

On Ubuntu 16.04 stuff changes due to `systemd`. No longer can you use output
redirection, this is now all handled via `systemd`. Create an override folder
for the `getty@tty1` service first:

    
    
    mkdir /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/
    

Edit the override file:

    
    
    vim /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/override.conf
    

Place the following:

    
    
    [Service]
    ExecStart=
    ExecStart=-/usr/bin/htop
    StandardInput=tty
    StandardOutput=tty
    

Now reload the unit files and restart the service. `htop` should appear on your
prompt:

    
    
    systemctl daemon-reload; systemctl restart getty@tty1.service
    

Or just do a `reboot`.

As a bonus, you can also install `hollywood`:

    
    
    apt-get install tmux hollywood # fill your console with Hollywood melodrama technobabble
    

and set that up to autorun on the console. Use the following in the `systemd`
file otherwise `byobu` will complain about wrong permissions on your homefolder:

    
    
    /usr/bin/sudo -H /usr/bin/hollywood
    

Much fun:
