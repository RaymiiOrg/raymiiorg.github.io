This is a guide on setting up an IPSEC VPN server on Ubuntu 16.04 using
StrongSwan as the IPsec server and for authentication. It has a detailed
explanation with every step. We choose the IPSEC protocol stack because of
vulnerabilities found in pptpd VPNs and because it is supported on all recent
operating systems by default.

### Why a VPN?

More than ever, your freedom and privacy when online is under threat.
Governments and ISPs want to control what you can and can't see while keeping a
record of everything you do, and even the shady-looking guy lurking around your
coffee shop or the airport gate can grab your bank details easier than you may
think. A self hosted VPN lets you surf the web the way it was intended:
anonymously and without oversight.

A VPN (virtual private network) creates a secure, encrypted tunnel through which
all of your online data passes back and forth. Any application that requires an
internet connection works with this self hosted VPN, including your web browser,
email client, and instant messaging program, keeping everything you do online
hidden from prying eyes while masking your physical location and giving you
unfettered access to any website or web service no matter where you happen to
live or travel to.

IPSEC encrypts your IP packets to provide encryption and authentication, so no
one can decrypt or forge data between your clients and your server. It also
provides a tunnel to send data to the server.

This VPN setup is called a road-warrior setup, because clients can connect from
anywhere. Another much used VPN setup is called site-to-site, where two VPN
servers connect two networks with one another. In a road warrior setup your
local network isn't shared, but you do get access to the server's network.

To work trough this tutorial you should have:

  * 1 Ubuntu 16.04 server with at least 1 public IP address and root access
  * 1 (or more) clients running an OS that support IPsec IKEv2 vpns (Ubuntu, Mac OS, Windows 7+, Android 4+).
  * Ports 4500/UDP, 500/UDP, 51/UDP and 50/UDP opened in the firewall.

I do all the steps as the root user. You should do to, but only via `sudo -i` or
`su -`.

### No L2TP?

A few of the previous tutorials used L2TP to set up the VPN tunnel and use IPSEC
only for the encryption. With the IKEv2 protocol and newer operating systems
(like OS X 10.8+, Android 4+, iOS 6+ and Windows 7+) supporting IKEv2 we can
also use IPSEC to set up the tunnel, before we used IPSEC to do that.

This VPN will therefore not work out of the box on older operating systems. See
my other tutorials with L2TP on how to do that.

### Overview

The tutorial consists out of the following steps:

  * Install packages
  * Generate certificates
  * Configure IPSEC
  * Configure Firewall

Android and Windows client configuration is covered at the end of the tutorial.

### Install Strongswan

StrongSwan is a descendant of FreeS/WAN, just like Openswan or LibreSwan.
Strongswan however is actively developed, whereas the other ones, except
LibreSwan are less. StrongSwan is in default in the Ubuntu repositories. You can
read more about Strongswan on [wikipedia][13] or their [website][14].

    
    
    apt-get install strongswan strongswan-plugin-af-alg strongswan-plugin-agent strongswan-plugin-certexpire strongswan-plugin-coupling strongswan-plugin-curl strongswan-plugin-dhcp strongswan-plugin-duplicheck strongswan-plugin-eap-aka strongswan-plugin-eap-aka-3gpp2 strongswan-plugin-eap-dynamic strongswan-plugin-eap-gtc strongswan-plugin-eap-mschapv2 strongswan-plugin-eap-peap strongswan-plugin-eap-radius strongswan-plugin-eap-tls strongswan-plugin-eap-ttls strongswan-plugin-error-notify strongswan-plugin-farp strongswan-plugin-fips-prf strongswan-plugin-gcrypt strongswan-plugin-gmp strongswan-plugin-ipseckey strongswan-plugin-kernel-libipsec strongswan-plugin-ldap strongswan-plugin-led strongswan-plugin-load-tester strongswan-plugin-lookip strongswan-plugin-ntru strongswan-plugin-pgp strongswan-plugin-pkcs11 strongswan-plugin-pubkey strongswan-plugin-radattr strongswan-plugin-sshkey strongswan-plugin-systime-fix strongswan-plugin-whitelist strongswan-plugin-xauth-eap strongswan-plugin-xauth-generic strongswan-plugin-xauth-noauth strongswan-plugin-xauth-pam 
    

### Certificates

The VPN server will identify itself with a certificate to the clients. The
clients should use a certificate to authenticate themself. Previous tutorials
also configured usernames and password and pre-shared keys, this tutorial does
not. Certificates are easier to use, can be revoked and are less hassle than
managing usernames and passwords.

On Android with the StrongSwan Application you can just import the `.p12` we are
going to create later on. OS X and iOS from 10.10 and 9 upwards also support
this authentication method.

You might want to install `haveged` to speed up the key generation process:

    
    
    apt-get install haveged
    systemctl enable haveged
    systemctl start haveged
    

Haveged provides a constant source of entropy and randomness.

Start by creating a self singed root CA private key:

    
    
    cd /etc/ipsec.d/
    mkdir private
    mkdir cacerts
    mkdir certs
    mkdir p12
    ipsec pki --gen --type rsa --size 4096 --outform der > private/strongswanKey.der
    chmod 600 private/strongswanKey.der
    

Generate a self signed root CA certificate of that private key:

    
    
    ipsec pki --self --ca --lifetime 3650 --in private/strongswanKey.der --type rsa --dn "C=NL, O=Example Company, CN=strongSwan Root CA" --outform der > cacerts/strongswanCert.der
    

You can view the certificate properties with the following command:

    
    
    ipsec pki --print --in cacerts/strongswanCert.der
    

Example output:

    
    
    cert:      X509
    subject:  "C=NL, O=Example Company, CN=strongSwan Root CA"
    issuer:   "C=NL, O=Example Company, CN=strongSwan Root CA"
    validity:  not before Dec 20 08:12:27 2015, ok
               not after  Dec 17 08:12:27 2025, ok (expires in 3649 days)
    serial:    1f:8e:0c:08:c4:a2:5b:1f
    flags:     CA CRLSign self-signed 
    authkeyId: d1:ad:f7:76:ad:10:02:7f:1d:04:e1:80:46:9d:b2:c7:fb:4d:d3:bb
    subjkeyId: d1:ad:f7:76:ad:10:02:7f:1d:04:e1:80:46:9d:b2:c7:fb:4d:d3:bb
    pubkey:    RSA 4096 bits
    keyid:     88:ef:88:13:7f:da:5a:28:13:77:4b:4c:81:df:ee:db:fb:5c:69:54
    subjkey:   d1:ad:f7:76:ad:10:02:7f:1d:04:e1:80:46:9d:b2:c7:fb:4d:d3:bb
    

Generate the VPN Host key. This is the keypair the VPN server host will use to
authenticate itself to clients. First the private key:

    
    
    ipsec pki --gen --type rsa --size 4096 --outform der > private/vpnHostKey.der
    chmod 600 private/vpnHostKey.der
    

Generate the public key and use our earlier created root ca to sign the public
key:

    
    
    ipsec pki --pub --in private/vpnHostKey.der --type rsa | ipsec pki --issue --lifetime 730 --cacert cacerts/strongswanCert.der --cakey private/strongswanKey.der --dn "C=NL, O=Example Company, CN=vpn.example.org" --san vpn.example.com --san vpn.example.net --san 85.222.227.169  --san @85.222.227.169 --flag serverAuth --flag ikeIntermediate --outform der > certs/vpnHostCert.der
    

The domain name or IP address of your VPN server, which is later entered in the
clients connection properties, MUST be contained either in the subject
Distinguished Name (CN) and/or in a subject Alternative Name (`--san`). If this
does not match the clients will fail to connect.

The built in Windows 7 VPN client needs the `serverAuth` extended key usage flag
in your host certificate as shown above, or the client will refuse to connect.
In addition, OS X 10.7.3 or older requires the `ikeIntermediate` flag, which we
also add here.

We add the IP address twice, one with an `@` in front so that it gets added as
an `subjectAltName` of the `DNSName` type and one of the `IPAddess` type.

Let's view the certificate:

    
    
    ipsec pki --print --in certs/vpnHostCert.der
    

Output:

    
    
    cert:      X509

    issuer:   "C=NL, O=Example Company, CN=strongSwan Root CA"

You can also use OpenSSL to see the contents, here is an excerpt:

    
    
    openssl x509 -inform DER -in certs/vpnHostCert.der -noout -text

        Signature Algorithm: sha1WithRSAEncryption
    

The private key (`/etc/ipsec.d/private/strongswanKey.der`) of the CA should be
moved somewhere safe, possibly to a special signing host without access to the
Internet. Theft of this master signing key would completely compromise your
public key infrastructure. Use it only to generate client certificates when
needed.

This key needs to be added into `/etc/ipsec.secrets`, otherwise StrongSwan will
not use it.

    
    
    vim /etc/ipsec.secrets
    

Add the key:

    
    
    # This file holds shared secrets or RSA private keys for authentication.
    
    # RSA private key for this host, authenticating it to any other host
    # which knows the public part.
    : RSA vpnHostKey.der
    

The format `: RSA keyname` is important, don't forget the space. You can check
afterwards if StrongSwan has the private key available with the `ipsec
listcerts` command:

    
    
    ipsec listcerts
    

Output:

If it doesn't say `has private key` on the `pubkey` line your filename or syntax
is wrong.

#### Client certificate

Any client will require a personal certificate in order to use the VPN. The
process is analogous to generating a host certificate, except that we identify a
client certificate by the clients e-mail address rather than a hostname.

We create a keypair for the example user "John".

Private key:

    
    
    ipsec pki --gen --type rsa --size 2048 --outform der > private/JohnKey.der
    chmod 600 private/JohnKey.der
    

Public key, signed by our root ca we generated:

    
    
    ipsec pki --pub --in private/JohnKey.der --type rsa | ipsec pki --issue --lifetime 730 --cacert cacerts/strongswanCert.der --cakey private/strongswanKey.der --dn "C=NL, O=Example Company, CN=john@example.org" --san "john@example.org" --san "john@example.net" --san "john@185.3.211.43" --outform der > certs/JohnCert.der
    

A VPN client needs a client certificate, its corresponding private key, and the
signing CA certificate. The most convenient way is to put everything in a single
signed PKCS#12 file and export it with a paraphrase.

Convert the required keys to PEM formt before converting to a .p12:

    
    
    openssl rsa -inform DER -in private/JohnKey.der -out private/JohnKey.pem -outform PEM
    
    
    openssl x509 -inform DER -in certs/JohnCert.der -out certs/JohnCert.pem -outform PEM
    
    
    openssl x509 -inform DER -in cacerts/strongswanCert.der -out cacerts/strongswanCert.pem -outform PEM
    

Construct the .p12:

    
    
    openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey private/JohnKey.pem -in certs/JohnCert.pem -name "John's VPN Certificate" -certfile cacerts/strongswanCert.pem -caname "strongSwan Root CA" -out p12/John.p12
    

Enter a passphrase twice, then you have a .p12. You can send `John.p12` and its
export paraphrase to the person who is going to install it onto the client. In
some cases (iOS for example) you have to separately include the CA certificate
`cacerts/strongswanCert.pem`.

Transport this `John.p12` file and the password over seperate channels to a
client.

If you need any more user certificates, repeat the above steps with other user
data. You can also do this later on.

#### Revoking a certificate

If a certificate is lost or stolen, it must be revoked so nobody can use it to
connect to your VPN server. Assuming the certificate from the previous step got
stolen, we revoke it with:

    
    
    cd /etc/ipsec.d/
    ipsec pki --signcrl --reason key-compromise --cacert cacerts/strongswanCert.der --cakey private/strongswanKey.der --cert certs/JohnCert.der --outform der > crls/crl.der
    

Restart ipsec afterwards:

    
    
    ipsec restart
    

This generates the new certificate revocation list (CRL) `crls/crl.der`. When
someone tries to authenticate with the stolen certificate, he'll receive an
authentication credentials error message, and your log file will contain
something like:

    
    
    04[CFG] using trusted certificate "C=NL, O=Example Company, CN=strongSwan Root CA"
    04[CFG]   crl correctly signed by "C=NL, O=Example Company, CN=strongSwan Root CA"
    04[CFG] certificate was revoked on Sep 10 10:15:33 UTC 2016, reason: key compromise
    

To add another revoked certificate to the same list, we need to copy the
existing list into a temporary file:

    
    
    cd /etc/ipsec.d/
    cp crls/crl.der crl.der.tmp
    ipsec pki --signcrl --reason key-compromise --cacert cacerts/strongswanCert.der --cakey private/strongswanKey.der --cert certs/OtherStolenCert.der --lastcrl crl.der.tmp --outform der > crls/crl.der
    rm crl.der.tmp
    

Restart ipsec afterwards:

    
    
    ipsec restart
    

### IPSEC Configuration

The main `ipsec` configuration file is located in `/etc/`. We are going to edit
it:

    
    
    vim /etc/ipsec.conf
    

Place the following contents:

    
    
    # ipsec.conf - strongSwan IPsec configuration file
    
    config setup
        charondebug="ike 2, knl 2, cfg 2, net 2, esp 2, dmn 2,  mgr 2"

        auto=add
    

The configuration has settings for IKEv2 + RSA certificates. This is, as stated
above, the most secure method. Older tutorials also set up IKEv1 (xauth) and
username-password combo, but that is considered insecure.

Apple added support for IKEv2 in iOS 8, but it needs to be configured using a
[custom configuration profile][15]. OS X 10.9 and lower do not support IKEv2.

Beginning with iOS 9, IKEv2 connections are natively supported. However, iOS9
only supports the use of certificates or username/password, but not both.

For iOS 9+ and OS X 10.10+ you need to make sure the `leftid=` is the same as
the `CN` in your certificate. You also need to enter that on the devices,
otherwise you'll get a `no matching peer config found` log error.

Android 4+ and Windows 7+ support IKEv2.

Clients will get the Google DNS servers and an IP address in the `10.42.42.0/24`
range. We use a strong ciphersuite.

The `leftcert=vpnHostCert.der` expands to the path
`/etc/ipsec.d/certs/vpnHostCert.der`.

### Firewall & Packet Routing

Configure the iptables firewall to allow vpn traffic and to forward packets:

    
    
    # for ISAKMP (handling of security associations)
    iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 500 --j ACCEPT
    # for NAT-T (handling of IPsec between natted devices)
    iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 4500 --j ACCEPT
    # for ESP payload (the encrypted data packets)
    iptables -A INPUT -p esp -j ACCEPT
    # for the routing of packets on the server
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j SNAT --to-source %SERVERIP% -o eth+
    

Replace `%SERVERIP%` with the external IP of the VPN server. If your external
interface is not named ethX (`+` is a wildcard) then rename appropriately.

Execute the below commands to enable kernel IP packet forwarding and disable ICP
redirects.

    
    
    echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1" |  tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
    echo "net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0" |  tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
    echo "net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0" |  tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
    echo "net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 0" |  tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
    echo "net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0" |  tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
    echo "net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0" |  tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
    echo "net.ipv4.icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses = 1" |  tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
    

Set these settings for other network interfaces:

    
    
    for vpn in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*; do echo 0 > $vpn/accept_redirects; echo 0 > $vpn/send_redirects; done
    

Apply them:

    
    
    sysctl -p
    

##### Persistent settings via /etc/rc.local

To make sure this keeps working at boot you might want to add the following to
/etc/rc.local:

    
    
    for vpn in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*; do echo 0 > $vpn/accept_redirects; echo 0 > $vpn/send_redirects; done
    iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j SNAT --to-source %SERVERIP% -o eth+
    iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 500 --j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 4500 --j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -p esp -j ACCEPT
    

Add it before the `exit 0` line and replace `%SERVERIP%` with the external IP of
your server.

### Start the VPN

All the configuration on the server is now done. Enable the VPN at startup:

    
    
    systemctl enable strongswan
    

And start it:

    
    
    systemctl start strongswan
    

If you get a permission denied error, stroke the files with apparmor:

    
    
    apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/usr.lib.ipsec.charon
    apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/usr.lib.ipsec.stroke
    

Check the status of the service:

    
    
    ipsec status
    

Output:

    
    
    Security Associations (0 up, 0 connecting):
      none
    

And a more elaborate status:

    
    
    ipsec statusall
    

Output:

### Client Configuration

See the [Strongswan Wiki][16] for guides on configuring Windows and [OS X/iOS
clients][17]

On Android, the easiest way is to install the [StrongSwan app][18], copy over
the `.p12` and connect with the IP and option `IKEv2 Certificate`. Nothing more:

![][19]

Just one tap to `Connect` and you're good to go:
