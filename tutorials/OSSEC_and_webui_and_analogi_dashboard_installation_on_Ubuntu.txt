OSSEC is an Open Source Host-based Intrusion Detection System that performs log
analysis, file integrity checking, policy monitoring, rootkit detection, real-
time alerting and active response. It runs on most operating systems, including
Linux, MacOS, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and Windows. It also includes agentless
monitoring for use with for example Cisco, HP or Juniper hardware.

This tutorial covers the installation of the OSSEC server, the standard OSSEC
Web UI and the Analogi dashboard on Ubuntu 12.04. It also covers OSSEC setup
with MySQL support, including a Makefile bugfix. Last but not least it shows you
how to install the OSSEC agent on a *NIX system.

There is a new version of OSSEC, 2.8. [There is also a new version of this
tutorial, for the new OSSEC and for Ubuntu 14.04. Click here to read it.][2]

[![OSSEC Analogi dashboard][3]][3]

This tutorial is written for an ubuntu 12.04 OSSEC server, but can be easily
adapted to other *NIX operating systems. It only covers basic OSSEC
client/server configuration, not automatic blocking or comprehensive
configuration settings. It gets you started, the rest is available in the
documentation: http://www.ossec.net/doc/

### Steps

  * Installing development packages
  * Installing Apache, PHP and MySQL
  * Configuring MySQL
  * Compiling the OSSEC server 
    * Makefile fix for Ubuntu
  * Basic OSSEC setup with MySQL
  * Installing OSSEC Web UI
  * Installing Analogi Web Dashboard

  * Installing and configuring a client

### Requirements

  * An Ubuntu 12.04 server
  * Apache2, PHP, MySQL and development packages
  * OSSEC clients to monitor (*NIX or Windows machines, Cisco switches etc).

### Installing development packages

OSSEC is installed from source, therefore you need development packages. This is
both for the OSSEC clients as for the OSSEC server:

    
    
    apt-get install build-essential make libssl-dev
    

### Installing Apache, MySQL and PHP

This is fairly simple on Ubuntu. It is all covered with apt:

    
    
    apt-get install mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev mysql-client apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql php5-curl php5-gd php5-intl php-pear php5-imagick php5-imap php5-mcrypt php5-memcache php5-ming php5-ps php5-pspell php5-recode php5-snmp php5-sqlite php5-tidy php5-xmlrpc php5-xsl
    

Remember to give a strong root password for MySQL. Next finish MySQL with a
secure installation:

    
    
    mysql_secure_installation
    

Accept all the suggested options. Now restart all requires services:

    
    
    /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
    /etc/init.d/mysqld restart
    

### Compiling the OSSEC server

Download and verify OSSEC, either via wget or from the website:
http://www.ossec.net/?page_id=19

    
    
    wget http://www.ossec.net/files/ossec-hids-2.7.tar.gz
    
    md5sum ossec-hids-2.7.tar.gz
    ossec-hids-2.7.tar.gz: 71cd21a20f22b8eafffa3b57250f0a70
    

From the OSSEC website:

    
    
    MD5(ossec-hids-2.7.tar.gz)= 71cd21a20f22b8eafffa3b57250f0a70
    SHA1(ossec-hids-2.7.tar.gz)= 721aa7649d5c1e37007b95a89e685af41a39da43
    

If it is correct, then extract it:

    
    
    tar -xf ossec-hids-2.7.tar.gz
    cd ossec-hids-2.7
    

We first need to fix MySQL support in the installation. Read on:

#### Makefile fix for Ubuntu

Because of some Ubuntu specific errors in compiling with MySQL support we need
to edit the MySQL Makefile:

    
    
    cd src
    vim os_dbd/Makefile
    

Change this line:

    
    
    ${CC} ${CFLAGS} ${OS_LINK} ${DBFLAGS} ${CDB} ${LOCAL} ${OBJS} -o ${NAME}
    

To this:

    
    
     ${CC} ${CFLAGS} ${OS_LINK} ${DBFLAGS} ${LOCAL} ${OBJS} -o ${NAME} ${CDB}
    

This is only needed in Ubuntu, Debian works fine.

Run:

    
    
    make setdb
    Error: PostgreSQL client libraries not installed.
    Info: Compiled with MySQL support.
    

Continue with the compilation/installation:

    
    
    cd ../
    ./install.sh
    
      ** For installation in English, choose [en].

     - In order to connect agent and server, you need to add each agent to the server.
       Run the 'manage_agents' to add or remove them:
    
       /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents
    
       More information at:
       http://www.ossec.net/en/manual.html#ma
    

OSSEC is now installed. Restart it:

    
    
    /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart
    

Continue to the next step for MySQL setup.

### Configuring MySQL

We need to create a user and database for OSSEC. Go to a MySQL shell:

    
    
    mysql -u root -p
    Enter password:
    [...]
    
    mysql> create database ossec;
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)
    
    grant INSERT,SELECT,UPDATE,CREATE,DELETE,EXECUTE on ossec.* to ossec_u;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
    
    set password for ossec_u = PASSWORD('Passw0rd');
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
    
    flush privileges;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
    
    quit;
    

The database also needs a schema. OSSEC provides a schema, it is located in the
extracted OSSEC folder, `src/os_dbd`. Import it into MySQL:

    
    
    mysql -u root -p ossec < src/os_dbd/mysql.schema
    

That's it for the database setup. Continue to see the OSSEC configuration.

### OSSEC MySQL configuration

We have to add the database config to `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf`:

    
    
    <ossec_config>
        <database_output>
            <hostname>127.0.0.1</hostname>
            <username>ossec_u</username>
            <password>Passw0rd</password>
            <database>ossec</database>
            <type>mysql</type>
        </database_output>
    </ossec_config>
    

Save it, then enable the database in OSSEC:

    
    
    /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control enable database
    /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart 
    

### Installing OSSEC Web UI

[![OSSEC Web UI][4]][4]

This is also quite simple. Because we've already set up Apache and PHP, we can
just download the web UI and extract to `/var/www/`:

    
    
    wget http://www.ossec.net/files/ossec-wui-0.8-beta-1.tar.gz
    tar -xf ossec-wui-0.8-beta-1.tar.gz
    mkdir /var/www/ossec/
    mv ossec-wui-0.8-beta-1/* /var/www/ossec/
    chown www-data:www-data /var/www/ossec/tmp/
    chmod 666 /var/www/ossec/tmp
    

We use the web UI Beta because there are a lot of errors (like broken search) in
the stable 0.3 version. We also set the correct permissions on the `tmp/`
folder. Afterwards the web ui is visible at http://hostname/ossec/.

### Installing Analogi Web Dashboard

[![OSSEC Analogi dashboard][3]][3]

The Analogi dashboard is a nice and informative dashboard around OSSEC, which
provides more visual information then the standard Web UI. The standard Web UI
has better search functions, the Dashboard can be used for example on a Wall
Mounted monitor and such.

Installation consists out of cloning the git repo and entering the settings
file:

    
    
    cd /var/www
    git clone https://github.com/ECSC/analogi.git
    cp analogi/db_ossec.php.new analogi/db_ossec.php
    vim analogi/db_ossec.php        
    

Edit the relevant settings for the MySQL database configuration. When correctly
configured the Analogi webinterface can be found at http://hostname/analogi/.

The OSSEC server is now correctly set up.

### Client installation

Download and verify the OSSEC stable .tar.gz file as described above. This time,
do an agent installation. See the output below:

    
    
    root@testclient:~/ossec-hids-2.7# ./install.sh

#### Client OSSEC config

Adding a client to OSSEC is quite simple. First you add the client to the
server, which gives you a key. Then you add this key to the client, edit the
config file on the client and that's it.

First we need to generate a key on the OSSEC server for this client. We do this
by running `/var/ossec/bin/manage_agents`, option A, then entering the hostname,
IP and ID for the client we want to add. Do these steps on the OSSEC server!:

    
    
    root@ossec:~# /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents
    
    ****************************************
    * OSSEC HIDS v2.7 Agent manager.     *
    * The following options are available: *
    ****************************************
       (A)dd an agent (A).
       (E)xtract key for an agent (E).
       (L)ist already added agents (L).
       (R)emove an agent (R).
       (Q)uit.
    Choose your action: A,E,L,R or Q: a
    
    - Adding a new agent (use '\q' to return to the main menu).
      Please provide the following:
       * A name for the new agent: testclient
       * The IP Address of the new agent: 10.0.51.32
       * An ID for the new agent[001]:
    Agent information:
       ID:001
       Name:testclient
       IP Address:10.0.51.32
    
    Confirm adding it?(y/n): y
    Agent added.
    

Now we find out the key for the OSSEC client:

    
    
    root@ossec:~# /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents
    
    ****************************************
    * OSSEC HIDS v2.7 Agent manager.     *
    * The following options are available: *
    ****************************************
       (A)dd an agent (A).
       (E)xtract key for an agent (E).
       (L)ist already added agents (L).
       (R)emove an agent (R).
       (Q)uit.
    Choose your action: A,E,L,R or Q: e
    
    Available agents:
       ID: 001, Name: testclient, IP: 10.0.51.32
    Provide the ID of the agent to extract the key (or '\q' to quit): 001
    
    Agent key information for '001' is:
    SD[...]AAUjd=
    
    ** Press ENTER to return to the main menu.
    

Then switch to the OSSEC client and execute the manage_agents:

    
    
    root@ossec:~# /var/ossec/bin/manage_agents
    
    ****************************************
    * OSSEC HIDS v2.7 Agent manager.     *
    * The following options are available: *
    ****************************************
       (I)mport key from the server (I).
       (Q)uit.
    Choose your action: I or Q: i
    
    * Provide the Key generated by the server.
    * The best approach is to cut and paste it.
    *** OBS: Do not include spaces or new lines.
    
    Paste it here (or '\q' to quit): SD[...]AAUjd=
    
    Agent information:
       ID:001
       Name:testclient
       IP Address:10.0.51.32
    
    Confirm adding it?(y/n): y
    Added.
    ** Press ENTER to return to the main menu.
    

And then this needs to be in the `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file:

    
    
    <client>
      <server-hostname>ossec.raymii.nl</server-hostname>
    </client>
    

Where `ossec.raymii.nl` is your OSSEC server URL or IP.

Now restart the OSSEC agents:

    
    
    /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart
    Killing ossec-monitord ..
    Killing ossec-logcollector ..
    Killing ossec-remoted ..
    Killing ossec-syscheckd ..
    Killing ossec-analysisd ..
    Killing ossec-maild ..
    Killing ossec-execd ..
    Killing ossec-dbd ..
    ossec-agentlessd not running ..
    OSSEC HIDS v2.7 Stopped
    Starting OSSEC HIDS v2.7 (by Trend Micro Inc.)...
    Started ossec-dbd...
    Started ossec-agentlessd...
    Started ossec-maild...
    Started ossec-execd...
    Started ossec-analysisd...
    Started ossec-logcollector...
    Started ossec-remoted...
    Started ossec-syscheckd...
    Started ossec-monitord...
    Completed.
    

That's it. Repeat these steps for any client that needs to be added. There are
both puppetfiles and chef cookbooks to manage this process.

### Bonus Tips

Here are a few bonus tips/config examples for OSSEC:

#### Ignoring rules

To very simply ignore rules based on rule id, add them to the XML file located
in `/var/ossec/rules/local_rules/xml`, either on the ossec client for one
machine or the ossec server to ignore on all machines:

    
    
    <!-- Specify here a list of rules to ignore. -->
    <!-- 3334 postfix start  -->
    <!-- 3333 postfix stop -->
    <rule id="100030" level="0">

#### Monitoring additional log files

The OSSEC agent by default only monitors a few log files. To add more, edit the
`/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file and add a line like this:

    
    
    <localfile>
        <location>/var/log/*</location>
        <log_format>syslog</log_format>
    </localfile>
    

This will add all files under `/var/log`. This might be a lot, you can also just
add multiple `<localfile>` blocks with filenames.

#### Firewall

You need to allow UDP port 1514 between OSSEC server and clients. Otherwise you
get errors like this:

    
    
    2013/09/06 19:53:00 ossec-agentd: INFO: Using IPv4 for: 10.0.51.31 .
    2013/09/06 19:53:21 ossec-agentd(4101): WARN: Waiting for server reply (not started). Tried: 'ossec.raymii.nl/10.0.51.31'.
