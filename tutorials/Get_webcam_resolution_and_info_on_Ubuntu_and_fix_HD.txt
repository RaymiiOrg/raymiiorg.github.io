With all the video calling nowdays due to working from home I decided to get a
webcam. Since I mostly work at a workstation, I have no microphone or camera 
built in. A friend gave me a spare webcam, a generic non-brand. It says "HD Camera"
on the box, but by default it records in 640x480. Using a few tools on Ubuntu
you can figure out what resolutions are supported for your device. 

It turned out to be Cheese, the webcam capture program I used, not supporting
the `mjpeg` format, just the `yuyv` RAW format. Using another webcam program 
named [Webcamoid][2] solved it, that program was able to use `mjpeg`.

Here's a picture of Cheese showing the possible resolutions, none of which are 
even near HD:

### lsusb

Via the device itself, without installing external software, you should be able 
to find out what resolutions are supported. First get the correct Bus and device ID:

    lsusb

Output:

    [...]
    Bus 003 Device 006: ID 1b3f:2247 Generalplus Technology Inc

Along with a bunch of `Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub`, but this is the device
I want to query. Bus 003, device 006. Query that device and grep for `Width|Height`:

    lsusb -s 003:006 -v | grep -E "Width|Height" 

Output:

        wWidth                           1920
        wHeight                          1080
        wWidth                           1280
        [...]

This should give you a general idea. For more detailed information, you can use
tools from `video4linux`.

### video4linux

`v4l`, or, video4linux is a long time project regarding all things video, on linux,
as the name might suggest. I remember using it with Mandrake back in the day to
get a camera working, and it's still going strong as a project. Install the 
required packages to get started:

     apt install v4l-utils

Query the camera directly, in my case it's `/dev/video0`:

    v4l2-ctl --list-formats-ext -d /dev/video0 

Output:

    ioctl: VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT
        Index       : 0
        Type        : Video Capture
        Pixel Format: 'MJPG' (compressed)

                Interval: Discrete 0.033s (30.000 fps)
            Size: Discrete 800x600
                Interval: Discrete 0.033s (30.000 fps)
            Size: Discrete 1920x1080
                Interval: Discrete 0.033s (30.000 fps)

        Index       : 1
        Type        : Video Capture
        Pixel Format: 'YUYV'
        Name        : YUYV 4:2:2
            Size: Discrete 640x480
                Interval: Discrete 0.033s (30.000 fps)
            Size: Discrete 640x360
                Interval: Discrete 0.033s (30.000 fps)
            Size: Discrete 320x240
                Interval: Discrete 0.033s (30.000 fps)
            Size: Discrete 176x144

            Size: Discrete 640x480
                Interval: Discrete 0.033s (30.000 fps)


Or, using `ffmpeg` for more compact output:

    ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -list_formats all -i /dev/video0

Output:

    Compressed:       mjpeg :          Motion-JPEG : 1920x1080 1280x720 800x480 640x480 640x360 320x240 176x144 800x600 1920x1080
    Raw       :     yuyv422 :           YUYV 4:2:2 : 640x480 640x360 320x240 176x144 640x480


### Solving the resolution issue with Cheese

I didn't find any options to use a different format or resolution with Cheese.
I tried `camorama` but that also has no configurable resolution. Then I tried
`guvcview` but that crashed my KDE desktop and at last I tried [Webcamoid][2].

That did have options for resolution and encoding, as you can see in the below
image:
