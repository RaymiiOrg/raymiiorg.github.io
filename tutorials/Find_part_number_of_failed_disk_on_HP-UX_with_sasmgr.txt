On one of my regular scheduled datacenter visits one of the older HP-UX Itanium
machines had an orange light on the front. These systems are not (yet)
monitored, but still in use so the disk had to be replaced. Not knowing anything
about this system or which parts were used, I managed to find the exact part
number and device type so we could order a spare. This small guide uses sasmgr
to get the data on HP-UX 11.31.

### Hardware Information on HP-UX

Since I normally don't manage these systems and have little experience with HP-
UX, I first had to find out some information on the system. Using a few regular
Unix tools like `netstat`, `uname` and a few HP-UX specific tools like `model`,
`machinfo` I was able to gather basic hardware information of this machine.

This system was installed a long while ago:

`print_manifest` is a usefull command for information on the system.

    
    
    hpux09:/root# print_manifest | grep -i created
        The system was created December 10, 2008, 18:02:06 MET.
        It was created with Ignite-UX revision C.7.7.93.
    

This will go into the hardware documentation, since, sadly, that is very
incomplete.

### Disk information

Now to the good part, for which we logged in to this machine. Find the serial
number and order a new (probably refurbished) disk. The system uses LVM with
RAID 1 underneath via a SAS card so when the disk is ordered we can just replace
it. If it was just LVM we had to do some configuration

This PDF [When _Good_ Disks _Go_ Bad.pdf][2] is very helpfull in preparing and
researching this issue. When the new disk is here, [this page][3] will be
helpfull for the replacement.

The first command shows which disk is the failed one plus the raid
configuration:

    
    
    sasmgr get_info -D /dev/sasd0 -q raid
    

Output:

The second command shows the location (controller-wise) and the part number of
the disk:

    
    
    sasmgr get_info -D /dev/sasd0 -q lun=all -q lun_locate 
    

Output:

    
    
    RAID VOL ID is 7 : 
    /dev/rdsk/c0t2d0          0/4/1/0.0.0.2.0          
    
    Physical disks in volume are :
            1     1     OFF           HP            EG0300FCSPH        HPD0
            1     7     OFF           HP            DG072BB975         HPDC
    
    RAID VOL ID is 2 :

            1     2     OFF           HP            DG146ABAB4         HPD5
    

In my case disk 1,2 failed:

    
    
        0x5000c50003aeb459   1     2    140014        SECONDARY       FAILED

With this part number we can order a new disk.

`dmesg` was also spitting out warning about this disk issue:
