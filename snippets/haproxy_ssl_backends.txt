This snippets shows you how to add an ssl backend to HAPROXY. You need haproxy
1.5 or higher, 1.4 does not support ssl backends.

Note: this is not about adding ssl to a frontend. this allows you to use an ssl
enabled website as backend for haproxy.

The following config is required in a `backend` section:

    
    
    backend example-backend
      balance roundrobin
      option httpchk GET /health_check
      server srv01 10.20.30.40:443 weight 1 maxconn 100 check ssl verify none
      server srv02 10.20.30.41:443 weight 1 maxconn 100 check ssl verify none
    

The important parts are:

    
    
    10.20.30.41:443 
    ssl verify none
    

You can also specify verify all. As expected, this will verify all certificates,
however this will generate extra load. For this example setup the `verify none`
is good enough.
