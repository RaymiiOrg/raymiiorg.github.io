This snippet shows you how to disable the OS X Notification Center completely,
the menu item and the sidebar. It also gives you the command to enable it again.

To disable the Notification Center completely, enter the following command in a
terminal:

    
    
    launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist
    

Then kill the remains with fire:

    
    
    killall -9 NotificationCenter
    

To enable it again:

    
    
    launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchAgents/com.apple.notificationcenterui.plist
    

If that doesn't work, you can also move the Application and reboot:

    
    
    sudo mv /System/Library/CoreServices/Notification\ Center.app /System/Library/CoreServices/Notification\ Center\ Disabled.app
