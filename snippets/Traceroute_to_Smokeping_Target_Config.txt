This little one-liner converts the output of traceroute to Smokeping Target
output. This way you can build your smokeping config faster.

There is an [IPv6 version of this article][2].

You can see smokeping in action [here at serverius][3]. More info about
[Smokeping here on the website][4].

I have most hops from my ISP in my smokeping config to see where the latency
might be. This traceroute one liner helps to get the right config.

    
    
    traceroute -w 3 example.org | grep -v "*" | sed -e 's/(//g' -e 's/)//g' | awk '{ gsub(/\./,"_",$2); print "++ "$2"\nmenu = "$3"\ntitle = "$2" - "$3"\nhost = "$3"\n"}'
    

The "*" are grepped out, the `()` are removed from the IP address and we also
replace . in the hostname so that Smokeping doesn't barf on that.

This will give you something like this (for [tweakers.net][5]:
    
    
    ++ 0_so-1-2-0_xr1_tc2_xs4all_net
    menu = 194.109.5.14
    title = 0_so-1-2-0_xr1_tc2_xs4all_net - 194.109.5.14
    host = 194.109.5.14
    
    ++ amsix_true_nl
    menu = 195.69.144.171
    title = amsix_true_nl - 195.69.144.171
    host = 195.69.144.171
    
    ++ ams7_edge01_tengig-6-1-11_true_nl
    menu = 87.233.1.218
    title = ams7_edge01_tengig-6-1-11_true_nl - 87.233.1.218
    host = 87.233.1.218
    
    ++ tweakers_net
    menu = 213.239.154.20
    title = tweakers_net - 213.239.154.20
    host = 213.239.154.20
    

Or for [reddit.com][6]:
    
    
    ++ 0_so-1-2-0_xr1_tc2_xs4all_net
    menu = 194.109.5.14
    title = 0_so-1-2-0_xr1_tc2_xs4all_net - 194.109.5.14
    host = 194.109.5.14
    
    ++ eth7-1_edge1_ams5_nl_atrato_net
    menu = 195.69.145.229
    title = eth7-1_edge1_ams5_nl_atrato_net - 195.69.145.229
    host = 195.69.145.229
    
    ++ eth1-6_edge2_ams5_nl_as5580_net
    menu = 78.152.44.44
    title = eth1-6_edge2_ams5_nl_as5580_net - 78.152.44.44
    host = 78.152.44.44
    
    ++ 78_152_38_234
    menu = 78.152.38.234
    title = 78_152_38_234 - 78.152.38.234
    host = 78.152.38.234
    
    ++ a23-62-98-210_deploy_static_akamaitechnologies_com
    menu = 23.62.98.210
    title = a23-62-98-210_deploy_static_akamaitechnologies_com - 23.62.98.210
    host = 23.62.98.210
    

This can be pasted right in to Smokeping's config.

I use the following version of Traceroute:

    
    
    $ traceroute -V
    Modern traceroute for Linux, version 2.0.19, Sep 29 2013
