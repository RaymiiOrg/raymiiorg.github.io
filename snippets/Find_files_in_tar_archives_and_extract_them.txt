This is a small tip, to find specific files in tar archives and how to extract
those specific files from said archive. Usefull when you have a 2 GB large tar
file with millions of small files, and you need just one.

### Finding files in tar archives

Using the command line flags `-ft` (long flags are `--file --list`) we can list
the contents of an archive. Using `grep` you can search that list for the
correct file. Example:

    
    
    tar -ft large_file.tar.gz | grep "the-filename-you-want"
    

Output:

    
    
    "full-path/to-the-file/in-the-archive/the-filename-you-want"
    

With a modern tar on modern linux you can omit the flags for compressed archives
and just pass a `.tar.gz` or `.tar.bz2` file directly.

### Extracting one file from a tar archive

When extracting a tar archive, you can specify the filename of the file you want
(full path, use the command above to find it), as the second command line
option. Example:

    
    
    tar -xf large_file.tar.gz "full-path/to-the-file/in-the-archive/the-filename-you-want"
    

It might just take a long time, at least for my 2 GB file it took a while.

An alternative is to use "mc" (midnight commander), which can open archive files
just a a local folder.
