Bash Bits are small examples, tips and tutorials for the bash shell. 
This bash bit shows you that find has a `-delete` option. I recently found this 
out, before I would always use `-exec rm {} \;`. This is shorter and easier to 
remember.

### find -delete flag

A long long time ago one of my co-workers showed me an option to `find` which 
removes all the files the find command found. Let's say I would want to remove 
all `.txt` files in a folder, I first would build the `find` command:

    find . -type f -iname "*.txt"

If it found files, a list of them will be printed to the console. After checking
the list, I would append the command to remove all found results:

    find . -type f -iname "*.txt" -exec rm {} \;

That would, for every file, run the command `rm filename;`. This is a lot of typing 
and depending on the shell you might need to escape characters (like here).

Just now I was looking to remove all empty directories and found on the find
[manpage][1] that it nowdays has a `-delete` flag. Which makes the above command 
easier:

    find . -type f -iname "*.txt" -delete

Or in my case, to remove empty directories:

    find . -type d -empty -delete

(if you omit the `-type d` find will also remove empty files).

The `-delete` flag will perform better since it doesn't have to spawn an external
`rm` process for every file. However, the [POSIX 1003.1 man page][2] for find 
specifies `-exec` but not `-delete`, thus the former being a requirement for POSIX
compatibility. Some embedded linux systems or UNIX systems therefore might also not
have the `delete` flag.

The [manpage][1] has more information including a warning:

> Delete  files;  true if removal succeeded.  If the removal failed, an error message
is issued.  If  -delete  fails,  find's  exit  status  will  be  nonzero  (when  it
eventually exits).  Use of -delete automatically turns on the '-depth' option.
Warnings: Don't forget that the find command line is evaluated as an expression, so
putting -delete first will make find try to delete everything  below  the  starting
points  you  specified.   When testing a find command line that you later intend to
use with -delete, you should explicitly specify -depth  in  order  to  avoid  later
surprises.
