And here is another nice little script for a problem I have. I use awesome as
window manager, and in my rc.lua file i've setup some nice tweaks so that my
wallpaper changes every 5 minutes to a new one randomly chosen from
`/usr/share/wallpapers/`.

(done by: `awsetbg -r '/usr/share/wallpapers'` in a crontab.)

I have a lot of wallpapers, over 1500. `awsetbg/feh` has some problems with
filenames and so once in a while I got an error message from `feh`,

This scripts renames all the jpg files in a folder to a number. Instead of
having `Beach.jpg`, `Clouds.jpg` and `Tux.jpg` you will have `1.jpg`, `2.jpg`
and `3.jpg`.

#### Script:

    
    
    #!/bin/bash
    RAYMIIWALL=1
    
    #convert everything to lowercase - you need the rename command.
    rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' *
    
    for i in {*.jpg,*.jpeg}; 
        do mv -f -v "$i" "$RAYMIIWALL.jpg";
        let "RAYMIIWALL += 1"
    done
    exit 0
    

If you get an error like:

`mv: cannot stat '*.jpeg': No such file or directory` then it means that there
are no jpeg files to rename.
