These small snippets create password strings you can put in `/etc/shadow` when
you need to reset a password on a system.

### Perl

    
    
    perl -e 'print crypt("password","\$6\$salt\$") . "\n"'
    

Replace `password` with the password, and `salt` with the salt. Need some random
stuff for the salt? `openssl` helps:

    
    
    openssl rand -base64 10 
    iDaorRK/57YZfQ==
    

### mkpasswd

On Ubuntu/Debian, install the `whois` package. On Arch, install `debian-whois-
mkpasswd` from the AUR.

    
    
    mkpasswd -m sha-512 password salt
    

### OpenSSL

If you need an older style `crypt` password you can use OpenSSL:

    
    
    openssl passwd -1 -salt salt password
