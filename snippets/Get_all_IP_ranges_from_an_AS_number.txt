One of my clients wanted to block a few social networking websites. Since they
have no IPv6 (yet) I figured the simplest way was to block access to the entire
IP range. This won't work for all the CDN networks they use, but it does get you
started.

To find all the ranges beloning to an AS number you can query the
`whois.radb.net` server with the AS number.

For Facebook for example:

    
    
    whois -h whois.radb.net '!gAS32934'
    A1063
    204.15.20.0/22 69.63.176.0/20 66.220.144.0/20 66.220.144.0/21 69.63.184.0/21 69.63.176.0/21 74.119.76.0/22 69.171.255.0/24 173.252.64.0/18 69.171.224.0/19 69.171.224.0/20 103.4.96.0/22 69.63.176.0/24 173.252.64.0/19 173.252.70.0/24 31.13.64.0/18 31.13.24.0/21 66.220.152.0/21 66.220.159.0/24 69.171.239.0/24 69.171.240.0/20 31.13.64.0/19 31.13.64.0/24 31.13.65.0/24 31.13.67.0/24 31.13.68.0/24 31.13.69.0/24 31.13.70.0/24 31.13.71.0/24 31.13.72.0/24 31.13.73.0/24 31.13.74.0/24 31.13.75.0/24 31.13.76.0/24 31.13.77.0/24 31.13.96.0/19 31.13.66.0/24 173.252.96.0/19 69.63.178.0/24 31.13.78.0/24 31.13.79.0/24 31.13.80.0/24 31.13.82.0/24 31.13.83.0/24 31.13.84.0/24 31.13.85.0/24 31.13.86.0/24 31.13.87.0/24 31.13.88.0/24 31.13.89.0/24 31.13.90.0/24 31.13.91.0/24 31.13.92.0/24 31.13.93.0/24 31.13.94.0/24 31.13.95.0/24 69.171.253.0/24 69.63.186.0/24 31.13.81.0/24 179.60.192.0/22 179.60.192.0/24 179.60.193.0/24 179.60.194.0/24 179.60.195.0/24 185.60.216.0/22 45.64.40.0/22 204.15.20.0/22 69.63.176.0/20 69.63.176.0/21 69.63.184.0/21 66.220.144.0/20 69.63.176.0/20
    

For CloudVPS:

    
    
    whois -h whois.radb.net '!gAS35470'
    A248
    194.60.207.0/24 79.170.88.0/21 89.31.96.0/21 217.170.21.0/24 193.138.204.0/22 178.18.80.0/20 31.3.96.0/21 141.138.192.0/20 212.32.226.0/24 37.34.48.0/21 37.230.96.0/21 93.191.128.0/21 185.21.188.0/22 213.187.240.0/21 85.222.224.0/21 185.3.208.0/22
    

To find an AS number, you can query this whois server with the IP address.
Linode for example:

    
    
    $ whois -h whois.radb.net  178.79.155.1
    route:          178.79.128.0/18
    descr:          Linode-2
    origin:         AS15830
    mnt-by:         Linode-mnt
    changed:        tasaro@linode.com 20100510
    source:         RIPE
    remarks:        ****************************
    remarks:        * THIS OBJECT IS NOT VALID
    remarks:        * Please note that all personal data has been removed from this object.
    remarks:        * To view the original object, please query the RIPE Database at:
    remarks:        * http://www.ripe.net/whois
    remarks:        ****************************
    

And then their AS number:

    
    
    $ whois -h whois.radb.net '!gAS15830'
    A3937
    217.68.16.0/22 217.20.46.0/24 [...] 213.52.183.0/24 213.52.182.0/24 212.111.40.0/24
    

A block can then be issued with the following `iptables` command:

    
    
    iptables -A INPUT -d 217.68.16.0/22 -j DROP
    

Where `-d` is the destination you want to make unreachable.

If you have the `ipset` extension enabled you can create a set of all the
ranges:

    
    
    ipset -N blocked_nets nethash
    ipset -A blocked_nets 194.60.207.0/24
    ipset -A blocked_nets 79.170.88.0/21
    ipset -A blocked_nets 89.31.96.0/21
    ipset -A blocked_nets 217.170.21.0/24
    ipset -A blocked_nets 193.138.204.0/22
    ipset -A blocked_nets 178.18.80.0/20
    ipset -A blocked_nets 31.3.96.0/21
    ipset -A blocked_nets 141.138.192.0/20
    ipset -A blocked_nets 212.32.226.0/24
    ipset -A blocked_nets 37.34.48.0/21
    ipset -A blocked_nets 37.230.96.0/21
    ipset -A blocked_nets 93.191.128.0/21
    ipset -A blocked_nets 185.21.188.0/22
    ipset -A blocked_nets 213.187.240.0/21
    ipset -A blocked_nets 85.222.224.0/21
    ipset -A blocked_nets 185.3.208.0/22
    

And create the rules to filter based on the `ipset`, which is faster when you
have a large amount of IP's and ranges.

    
    
    iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set blocked_nets src,dst -j DROP
