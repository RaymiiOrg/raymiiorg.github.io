Recently I was debugging connection issues with a system that uses
connman as it's network management software. In the log it was visible that 
the connection went away and came back, logged with ' `operstate $number $state`.
I couldn't easily find an overview of all the possible states, but since it's 
open source we can take a look at the code to find out. Publishing it here
for future reference.

### Log

The relevant parts of the logging look like this:

    Jun 22 19:41:33 hostname connmand[8080]: eth1 {newlink} index 5 operstate 6 <UP>
    Jun 23 16:34:07 hostname connmand[26069]: eth1 {update} flags 36866 <DOWN>
    Jun 23 16:34:07 hostname connmand[26069]: eth1 {newlink} index 5 operstate 2 <DOWN>
    Jun 23 16:34:08 hostname connmand[26069]: eth1 {newlink} index 5 operstate 6 <UP>
    Jun 23 16:34:08 hostname connmand[26069]: eth1 {update} flags 36867 <UP>
    Jun 23 16:34:08 hostname connmand[26069]: eth1 {newlink} index 5 operstate 2 <DOWN>
    Jun 23 16:34:10 hostname connmand[26069]: eth1 {newlink} index 5 operstate 6 <UP>


The different manpages and online search results didn't give me the information 
I was looking for, so I cloned the repository and turned to trusty old `grep`.

    git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/connman/connman.git/
    cd connman

Searching recursively:

    grep -iInHr "operstate" * 

The first hit was what I was looking for:

    src/rtnl.c:344:static const char *operstate2str(unsigned char operstate)
    src/rtnl.c:346: switch (operstate) {


You can view the code [online via gitweb][1], but here's the list, I've added
the comments with the numbers per state:

    static const char *operstate2str(unsigned char operstate)
    {
        switch (operstate) {
        case IF_OPER_UNKNOWN: //0
            return "UNKNOWN";
        case IF_OPER_NOTPRESENT: //1
            return "NOT-PRESENT";
        case IF_OPER_DOWN: //2
            return "DOWN";
        case IF_OPER_LOWERLAYERDOWN: //3
            return "LOWER-LAYER-DOWN";
        case IF_OPER_TESTING: //4
            return "TESTING"; 
        case IF_OPER_DORMANT: //5
            return "DORMANT";
        case IF_OPER_UP: //6
            return "UP";
        }

        return "";
    }


This info is what I was looking for to use in further automated log analysis.
