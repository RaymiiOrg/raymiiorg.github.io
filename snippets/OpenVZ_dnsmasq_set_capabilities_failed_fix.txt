When running dnsmasq under OpenVZ I sometimes get an error when restarting: set
capabilities failed. This is because dnsmasq starts as root, then does
privileged stuff and then drops to the configured run user. In OpenVZ these
permissions are not passed to the VPS, sadly. These three commands fix the
problem.

Replace 195 with your container ID in the steps below.

Stop the container:

    
    
    vzctl stop 195
    

Give it extra permissions:

    
    
    vzctl set 195 --capability setuid:on --save
    vzctl set 195 --capability net_admin:on --save
    vzctl set 195 --capability net_raw:on --save
    

Then start it again:

    
    
    vzctl start 195
