This snippet shows you how to use haproxy to restrict certain URLs to certain IP
addresses. For example, to make sure your admin interface can only be accessed
from your company IP address.

This example restricts access to the `/admin/` and `/helpdesk` URL's. It only
allows access from the IP addresses `20.30.40.50` and `20.30.40.40`. Any other
IP addresses will get the standard haproxy 403 forbidden error.

### ACL for URL's

It uses the acl option. If the requested path begins with either `/admin` or
`/helpdesk` haproxy sets the `restricted_page` acl. haproxy also looks at the
requesting source IP address. If that matches any of the two IP addresses, it
sets the `network_allowed` acl. If the `allowed_network` acl is set and the
`restricted_page` is also set, it allows a visitor to go to the page. If the
`restricted_page` acl is set but the `allowed_network` is not, haproxy will
serve a 403 error, thus, disallowing access to that specific URL.

Note that you can use IP addresses but also networks in the `src` acl. Both
`192.168.20.0/24` and `192.168.10.3` work.

    
    
    frontend example-frontend
      [...]
      acl network_allowed src 20.30.40.50 20.30.40.40
      acl restricted_page path_beg /admin
      acl restricted_page path_beg /helpdesk
      block if restricted_page !network_allowed
      [...]
    

To use a specific file as error page, use the following config in the defaults
section:

    
    
    defaults
      [...]
      errorfile 400 /etc/haproxy/errors/400.http
      errorfile 403 /etc/haproxy/errors/403.http
      errorfile 408 /etc/haproxy/errors/408.http
      errorfile 500 /etc/haproxy/errors/500.http
      errorfile 502 /etc/haproxy/errors/502.http
      errorfile 503 /etc/haproxy/errors/503.http
      errorfile 504 /etc/haproxy/errors/504.http
    

The `http` files are regular HTML files with a HTTP response on top, like so:

    
    
      HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden
      Cache-Control: no-cache
      Connection: close
      Content-Type: text/html
      <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
      <html><head>
      <title>403 Forbidden</title>
      </head><body>
      <h1>Forbidden</h1>
      <p>You don't have permission to access this area
      on this server.</p>
      <hr>
      <address>Apache/2.4.12 (Ubuntu) Server at example.org Port 443</address>
      </body></html>
    

This is the default apache error page.

### ACL for TCP backends

** update 2017-01-09 **

If you have a non-http service you want to restrict to a few IP's you can use an
ACL together with the `tcp-request connection reject` optio. Here below is a
simple example for a MySQL service. Do note that this also works in a `frontend`
block:

    
    
    listen mysql
          bind            1.2.3.4:3306
          mode            tcp
          acl             network_allowed src 20.30.40.50 8.9.9.0/27
          tcp-request     connection reject if !network_allowed
          server          mysqlvip 10.0.0.30:3306

### Password if not from whitelisted network

If you want access to the resource, but are not on the whitelisted network, the
recommended way is to setup a VPN. But, if that is not feasable, the below trick
allows you to prompt for a password if you're from a different network.

First setup a `userlist`:

    
    
    userlist UsersFor_Example
      user user1 insecure-password password1
      user user2 insecure-password password2
    

This is comparable with your `.htpasswd` file.

In your frontend, where you have the ACL:

    
    
    frontend example-frontend
      [...]
      acl network_allowed src 20.30.40.50 20.30.40.40
      acl restricted_page path_beg /admin
      acl restricted_page path_beg /helpdesk
      block if restricted_page !network_allowed
      [...]
    

Remove the last line (`block if`) and make the section look like below:

    
    
    frontend example-frontend
      [...]
      acl network_allowed src 20.30.40.50 20.30.40.40
      acl restricted_page path_beg /admin
      acl restricted_page path_beg /helpdesk
      acl auth_ok http_auth(UsersFor_Example)
      http-request auth if restricted_page !network_allowed !auth_ok
      [...]
    

If you're on the whitelisted network, you are given access. If you're on a
different network, you will be prompted for a password. Make sure you're only
using this over an HTTPS protected frontend.
