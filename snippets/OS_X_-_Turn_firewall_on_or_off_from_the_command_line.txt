To turn the firewall _off_ :

    
    
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf globalstate -int 0
    

To turn the firewall _on for specific applications/services_ :

    
    
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf globalstate -int 1
    

To turn the firewall _on for essential services like DHCP and ipsec, block all
the rest_ :

    
    
    sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.alf globalstate -int 2
