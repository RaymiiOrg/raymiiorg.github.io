My [k3s cluster](/s/tutorials/My_First_Kubernetes_k3s_cluster_on_3_Orange_Pi_Zero_3s_including_k8s_dashboard_hello-node_and_failover.html) runs on Orange Pi Zero 3 small board computers, with a 1.5 GHz Allwinner H618 Quad-Core Cortex-A53 ARM64 CPU. Nowadays most popular software has support for `aarch64` due to the popularity of boards like the Raspberry Pi and the Apple M1 series processors, but smaller projects or niche software often can only run on x86/amd64. If you write your own yaml files for deployment you can use a `nodeSelector` combined with the `kubernetes.io/arch=amd64`, but with a Helm Chart this is not that obvious. This small snippets shows you the correct syntax to force deploy a Helm Chart to only amd64 nodes in your cluster. This assumes you have a mixed cluster, I added a small virtual machine to it for testing.

This is my cluster

The version of [Kubernetes/k3s](https://docs.k3s.io/release-notes/v1.29.X) I use
for this article is `v1.29.6+k3s1`.

The [Kubernetes documentation on `nodeSelector`]
(https://web.archive.org/web/20240711184149/https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/)
is comprehensive and covers more than just forcing a node, also affinity and
more.

In my case I just want to deploy a Helm Chart, not fiddle with yaml. By default most Helm Charts 

You can use the `--set` parameter to add a `nodeSelector` to your `helm install`:

    --set nodeSelector."\.kubernetes\.io/arch"=amd64

For example, to install [urunner](https://github.com/texano00/urunner), which currently does [not work on arm64](https://github.com/texano00/urunner/issues/14), use the following command:    


    helm upgrade --install urunner oci://ghcr.io/texano00/urunner/helm/urunner --version 0.1.0 --values values.yaml -n urunner --create-namespace --set nodeSelector."\.kubernetes\.io/arch"=amd64

One other project, [canary-checker, has added arm64 support on my request]
(https://github.com/flanksource/canary-checker/issues/1938)! That now works
on my Orange Pi Zero 3 nodes, I hope that `urunner` will add support soon.
