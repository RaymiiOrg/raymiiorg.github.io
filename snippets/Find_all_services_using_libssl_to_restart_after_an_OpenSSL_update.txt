![Openssl][1]

When you update OpenSSL, the software that currently has the ssl libraries
loaded in memory do not automatically load the updated libraries. A full system
reboot resolves that problem, but sometimes that is not possible. This command
shows you all the software that has loaded the libraries, allowing you to
restart only those services. If you don't restart or reload after an update, the
software might still be vulnerable to issues that the update fixed.

Make sure you have the `lsof` command installed. Your package manager probably
has this package.

Using the following command you get a list of services currently using libssl:

    
    
    lsof | grep libssl | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq
    

On a Directadmin shared hosting server this is the output:

    
    
    directadm
    exim
    httpd
    imap-logi
    managesie
    nrpe
    php
    pop3-logi
    pure-ftpd
    spamd
    

Not all the filenames are complete but you can fill those in. If you leave out
the last part of the command you can also see which specific library is in use:

    
    
    lsof | grep libssl
    

Example output:

    
    
    imap-logi   449   dovecot  mem       REG              202,1    539869      85375 /usr/lib64/libssl.so.1.0.0
    httpd       876    apache  mem       REG              202,1    539869      85375 /usr/lib64/libssl.so.1.0.0  
    [...]
    spamd     13513      root  mem       REG              202,1    444168      85398 /usr/lib64/libssl.so.1.0.1e
    

Here you can see some services using a different library, those still need a
restart.

_Update_. Tzu sent me an email with his command to find all updated libraries
and services using the old ones:

    
    
    lsof | grep 'DEL.*lib' | cut -f 1 -d ' ' | sort -u
