This small article will show you how to remove unused kernels in Red Hat or
CentOS. This is sometimes necessary because the /boot partition can fill up.

[Are you running Ubuntu and want to clean up kernels? See this article:

You can check which kernels you have installed using the `rpm -q kernel`
command:

    
    
    $ rpm -q kernel
    kernel-2.6.18-348.16.1.el5
    kernel-2.6.18-348.18.1.el5
    kernel-2.6.18-371.el5
    kernel-2.6.18-371.1.2.el5
    kernel-2.6.18-371.3.1.el5
    

As you can see this is a CentOS 5 box.

In the `yum-utils` package there is the `package-cleanup` command. This command,
among other things, lets you remove older kernels very simple. First install it:

    
    
    yum install yum-utils
    

With the following command you can clean up all old kernels and keep just two.
The current one and the previous one:

    
    
    package-cleanup --oldkernels --count=2
    

The Fedora Documentation has more info and various good examples on the
`package-cleanup` command: [https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-
