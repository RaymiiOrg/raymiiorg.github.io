tping is a bash alias I once got from an old co-worker. It's ping, but with a
timestamp. Instead of looking at the increased icmp_seq number you now have a
timestamp. Here's how it looks like:

    
    
    $ tping 192.0.2.10
    09:31:55: PING 192.0.2.10 (192.0.2.10) 56(84) bytes of data.

The host went down on 09:32 and was back up on 09:36. This was a scheduled
reboot.

### .bashrc function

The shell code for in your `.bashrc` file:

    
    
    tping() {
        ping $@ | while read pong; do 
            echo "$(date +"%T"): $pong"; 
        done
    }
    alias tping=tping
    

Start a new shell our `source .bashrc` after you added this function.

### Prettyping

Another tool to get more visual information from ping is `prettyping`. It's
[open source on github][2] and looks like this:

The red exclamation marks in the image represent a reboot of that server.
