This is a short command to generate a CSR (certificate signing request) with
openssl without being prompted for the values which go in the certificate's
Subject field.

When you use OpenSSL to generate a CSR and a private key you use the following
command:

    
    
    openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.key -out CSR.csr
    

This is the output:

    
    
    Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
    .................................................................+++
    .......................................................................+++
    writing new private key to 'private.key'
    -----
    You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
    into your certificate request.
    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
    For some fields there will be a default value,
    If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
    -----
    Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:NL
    State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Zuid Holland
    Locality Name (eg, city) []:Rotterdam
    Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Sparkling Network
    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:IT Department
    Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:ssl.raymii.org
    Email Address []:
    
    Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
    to be sent with your certificate request
    A challenge password []:
    An optional company name []:
    

You can see that you have to fill in a lot of data during the generation. If you
do not want that, maybe because you are using a script to generate a lot of
CSR's and private keys, you use the following command. It does the same as the
above command, but it has all the data in it:

    
    
    openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.key -out CSR.csr -subj "/C=NL/ST=Zuid Holland/L=Rotterdam/O=Sparkling Network/OU=IT Department/CN=ssl.raymii.org"
    

This is the output:

    
    
    Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
    .......+++
    ..............................................................................................................................................+++
    writing new private key to 'private.key'
    -----
    

This is what the `-subj` option does:

  * /C=NL: 2 letter ISO country code (Netherlands)
  * /ST=: State, Zuid Holland (South holland)
  * /L=: Location, city (Rotterdam)
  * /O=: Organization (Sparkling Network)
  * /OU=: Organizational Unit, Department (IT Department, Sales)
  * /CN=: Common Name, for a website certificate this is the FQDN. (ssl.raymii.org)

You can also give a `/serialNumber=0123456` with the above option. [This is NOT
the serial number the issuing Certificate Authority (CA) will use, but a way to
give extra information to a certificate. If you have a CN for John Doe, and
another one, the serialNumber field can be used to distinguish John Doe 1 from
John Doe 2's certificate. Click here for more info.][2]
