This is a small script to gather some statistics from your Firefox history.
First we use sqlite3 to parse the Firefox history database and get the last
three months, then we remove all the IP addresses and port numbers and finally
we sort and count it.

    #!/bin/bash
    if [[ ! -d ${HOME}/.www ]]; then
      mkdir ${HOME}/.www/
    fi
    
    cp "$(find "${HOME}/.mozilla/firefox/" -name "places.sqlite" | head -n 1)" "${HOME}/.www/places.sqlite"
    sqlite3 "${HOME}/.www/places.sqlite" "SELECT url FROM moz_places, moz_historyvisits \
                           WHERE moz_places.id = moz_historyvisits.place_id \
                                 and visit_date > strftime('%s','now','-3 month')*1000000 ORDER by \
                           visit_date;"  > "${HOME}/.www/urls-unsorted"
    sort -u "${HOME}/.www/urls-unsorted" > "${HOME}/.www/urls"
    
    awk -F/ '{print $3}' "${HOME}/.www/urls" | grep -v -E -e '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' -e ':.*' -e '^$' | sed -e 's/www\.//g' |sort | uniq -c | sort -n 
    

Example output:

    
    
        383 lowendtalk.com
        534 reddit.com
        569 google.com
        574 github.com
        792 encrypted.google.com
        973 i.imgur.com
       1458 next.duckduckgo.com
       3009 duckduckgo.com
       6459 wiki.int
      12934 management.int
    

If you just want HTTPS domains, or just HTTP you can use awk to make that
happen:

    
    
    awk -F/ '$1 == "https:" {print $3}' "${HOME}/.www/urls" | grep -v -E -e '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}' | sort | uniq -c | sort
