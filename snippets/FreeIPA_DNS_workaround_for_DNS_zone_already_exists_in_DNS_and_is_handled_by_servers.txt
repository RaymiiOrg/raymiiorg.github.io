Recently I ran into an issue with FreeIPA when trying to add an existing DNS
zone. The zone already exists on the internet so, logically, FreeIPA wouldn't
allow me to hijack this domain locally. My usecase is special, so I wanted to
forcefully add this zone as a forward zone.

In the web UI of FreeIPA when trying to add this existing zone, the following
error appears:

    
    
    DNS zone example.org. already exists in DNS and is handled by server(s): ns1.kpn.com, ns2.kpn.com
    

This is a logical error since hijacking a domain like this is a bad idea,
features like DNSSEC will bite you.

My setup however was different. In this setup, domain `sub.example.org` was
delegated to this environment, but via some tunneling constructions VPSes in
this environment would be able to connect internally to the `example.org`
domain. So, I want the FreeIPA system that is also the DNS resolver, to forward
queries for `example.org` to the local internal nameserver in the `example.org`
domain, and not resolving them externally.

FreeIPA wouldn't let me do that via the GUI. Which is IMHO the good option,
since you are doing something that normally will break stuff. Using the
commandline we can skip this overlap check with the `--skip-overlap-check` flag:

    
    
     ipa dnsforwardzone-add  --skip-overlap-check example.org --forwarder=192.0.2.10 --forwarder=198.51.100.10 --forward-policy=only
    Server will check DNS forwarder(s).
    This may take some time, please wait ...
      Zone name: example.org.
      Active zone: TRUE
      Zone forwarders: 192.0.2.10, 198.51.100.10
      Forward policy: only
    

If you do not want to add a forward zone, you can also use this flag to add a
regular zone:

    
    
    ipa dnszone-add --skip-overlap-check example.org --forwarder=192.0.2.10 --forwarder=198.51.100.10 --forward-policy=only
