Below you'll find the script that makes nice thumbnails from a bunch of images.
I've used it on the links page on this website. (Which is not around anymore).
First I made screenshots of the website's I wanted, with the firefox add-on
screengrab. It also works with pictures, but then you'll have to change the png
to jpg in the script. The script also makes a HTML page with a 2 collumn table
witth the thumbs in it.
