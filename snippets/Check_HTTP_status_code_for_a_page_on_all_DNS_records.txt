This is a small snippet using curl to check the status code of a given URL on
all DNS records for a given domain. This site has a few A records in round robin
mode, and sometimes the automatic deployment fails. Using this query I can check
which server is the culprit and fix it manually.

The normal HEAD request output also shows all the headers the server sends and
that is a pain to scroll through. This just shows me the HTTP status code, which
is all I want.

    
    
    dig +short A raymii.org | awk '{print "echo "$1"; curl -s -k -o /dev/null -I -w \"%{http_code}\" https://"$1"/s/blog/Burn_in_testing_for_Hypervisor_and_Storage_servers.html; echo; echo"}' | bash
    

Example output:

    
    
    163.172.129.56
    200
    
    185.54.115.97
    404
    
    213.187.244.250
    000
    
    81.4.120.226
    200
    

The first and last server are correct. The middle one with status code `000` is
offline and the `404` code is also not up to date.

For IPv6 and AAAA records, we add brackets:

    
    
    dig +short AAAA raymii.org | awk '{print "echo "$1"; curl -6 -s -k -o /dev/null -I -w \"%{http_code}\" https://["$1"]/s/blog/Burn_in_testing_for_Hypervisor_and_Storage_servers.html; echo; echo"}' | bash
    

Example output:

    
    
    2a00:d880:5:783::2
    200
    
    2a04:92c7:e:4d1::5436
    200
