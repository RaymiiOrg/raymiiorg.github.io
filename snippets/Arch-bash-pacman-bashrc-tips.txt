So, I have some nice tips for your .bashrc, with screenshots. Also a handy
command to show your biggest packages in pacman/arch.

##### Simple Calendar with today marked as

![tcal][2]

    
    
    alias tcal='cal | sed "s/^/ /;s/$/ /;s/ $(date +%e) / $(date +%e | sed '''s/./#/g''') /"' 
    

##### Fast cd up:

    
    
    alias ..='cd ..'
    alias ...='cd ../..' 
    

##### Network Info (LAN IP, IP and MAC):

![netinf][3]

    
    
    netinfo ()
    {
    echo "Internal IPv4 address of eth0: "; ifconfig | grep 'inet addr:'| grep -v '127.0.0.1' | cut -d: -f2 | awk '{ print $1}'
    echo "External IPv4 address: "; wget -q -O - checkip.dyndns.org|sed -e 's/.*Current IP Address: //' -e 's/
    

##### Biggest folders in directory Gigabyte version:

![dug][4]

    
    
    alias dug='du -h | grep ^[0-9.]*G | sort -rn | head -n 20'
    

##### Biggest folders in directory Megabyte version:

![dum][5]

    
    
    alias dum='du -h | grep ^[0-9.]*M | sort -rn | head -n 20'
    

##### Process Grep:

![pg][6]

    
    
    alias pg='ps -ef | grep '
    

##### Nice greeting when opening a bash shell:

![welcome][7]

    
    
    PS1="u@h  -  tn${PWD}/ -$ "
    echo "Welkom Remy,"
    echo "Het is vandaag:";
    date
    echo "Deze PC draait op een:" 
    /bin/uname -p
    echo ""
    netinfo;
    

(put this one at the end of your .bashrc file)

##### And the huge packages finder:

![dup][8]

    
    
    #!/bin/bash
    pacman -Qi | awk '/Name/ { name=$3 } /Size/ { printf "%.3fMBt%sn", $4/1024, name }' | sort -rh | head -n $1
    exit 0
    

(I've put this in /usr/bin/dup and chmodded it to 755).

Thanks to the arch forum for most of these tips!
