This snippet shows you how to set specific ciphers for haproxy when using an ssl
frontend.

This can be used for example to allow or disallow specific SSL ciphers.

This was tested on haproxy 1.5.

The following config is required in a `frontend` section:

    
    
    frontend example-frontend
      reqadd X-Forwarded-Proto:\ https
      rspadd Strict-Transport-Security:\ max-age=31536000;\ includeSubDomains
      option forwardfor except 127.0.0.1
      maxconn 100
      bind 10.20.30.40:443 ssl crt /etc/ssl/certs/example.pem ciphers ECDHE+aRSA+AES256+GCM+SHA384:ECDHE+aRSA+AES128+GCM+SHA256:ECDHE+aRSA+AES256+SHA384:ECDHE+aRSA+AES128+SHA256:ECDHE+aRSA+RC4+SHA:ECDHE+aRSA+AES256+SHA:ECDHE+aRSA+AES128+SHA:AES256+GCM+SHA384:AES128+GCM+SHA256:AES128+SHA256:AES256+SHA256:DHE+aRSA+AES128+SHA:RC4+SHA:HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!EXP:!PSK:!SRP:!DSS
      default_backend example_backend
    

This is the important bit:

    
    
    bind 10.20.30.40:443 ssl crt /etc/ssl/certs/example.pem ciphers ECDHE+aRSA+AES256+GCM+SHA384:ECDHE+aRSA+AES128+GCM+SHA256:ECDHE+aRSA+AES256+SHA384:ECDHE+aRSA+AES128+SHA256:ECDHE+aRSA+RC4+SHA:ECDHE+aRSA+AES256+SHA:ECDHE+aRSA+AES128+SHA:AES256+GCM+SHA384:AES128+GCM+SHA256:AES128+SHA256:AES256+SHA256:DHE+aRSA+AES128+SHA:RC4+SHA:HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!EXP:!PSK:!SRP:!DSS
    

This is an specific cipher suite for use with TLS 1.2 with RC4 as fallback.
