Today I had to set up something but I kept getting ssl errors. Turns out, the
certificate did not match the private key, because the private key file was
damaged. After I copied the certificate all was good, so it might got damaged
while `scping` it.

The following `openssl` commands give you the hash of the modulus of certificate
and the private key. If those two don't match then they either do not below to
each other, or the file is damaged.

My private key is named `private.key` and my certificate file is named
`certificate.crt`. Both are in PEM format.

Certificate:

    
    
    openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in certificate.crt | openssl md5
    (stdin)= d238708c18b3c0d42994cfb61f060467
    

Private Key:

    
    
    openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in private.key | openssl md5 
    (stdin)= 5dd148535fb0763926c285c83cb6b58
    

They don't match... This was the result after I did another `scp`:

    
    
    openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in private.key | openssl md5
    (stdin)= d238708c18b3c0d42994cfb61f060467
    

Perfect match!
