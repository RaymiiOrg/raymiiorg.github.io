On Ubuntu and Debian (12.04/6) the munin plugins which graphs mysql by default
gives the following error:

    
    
    Missing dependency Cache::Cache at /usr/share/munin/plugins/mysql_ line 716.

This is because a Perl cache package is needed. In the repositories there are
two of those packages. Install them both:

    
    
    ## Execute as root
    apt-get install libcache-{perl,cache-perl} 
    

Now generate the munin plugin config again:

    
    
    ## Execute as root
    munin-node-configure --suggest --shell | sh
    

And restart the munin-node service:

    
    
    ## Execute as root
    /etc/init.d/munin-node restart
    

The graphs should now appear. If not, you might need to manually symlink the
munin mysql plugins from `/usr/share/munin/plugins/` to `/etc/munin/plugins/`.

If you need to define another user for MySQL, configure `/etc/munin/plugin-
conf.d/munin-node` with the following settings:

    
    
    [mysql*]
    user root
    env.mysqluser monitoring
    env.mysqlpassword MyOwnSuperSecretPassword
    

Altough on Ubuntu and Debian this should run via the debian maintenance user.
