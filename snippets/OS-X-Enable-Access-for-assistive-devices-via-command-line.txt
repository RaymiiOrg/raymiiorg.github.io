### Mavericks

In Mavericks Apple changed the permissions so that every app has to be given
permission individually. Therefore we need to do a bit more work. We first need
to get the applications Bundle Identifier:

    
    
    /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print CFBundleIdentifier' /Applications/<Appname.app>/Contents/Info.plist
    com.apple.Safari
    

For SpectacleApp:

    
    
    /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print CFBundleIdentifier' /Applications/Spectacle.app/Contents/Info.plist
    com.divisiblebyzero.Spectacle
    

Then we use the Bundle ID in the following command to modify the permission
database:

    
    
    sudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db "INSERT INTO access VALUES('kTCCServiceAccessibility','<Bundle-ID>',0,1,1,NULL);" 
    

For SpectacleApp:

    
    
    sudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db "INSERT INTO access VALUES('kTCCServiceAccessibility','com.divisiblebyzero.Spectacle',0,1,1,NULL);"
    

To remove an application from the list we use the following command, with the
correct bundle ID:

    
    
    sudo sqlite3 /Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db "delete from access where client='<Bundle ID>';"
    

### Mountain Lion and Lion

On OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) or Lion (10.7) simply run this command as root:

    
    
    touch /private/var/db/.AccessibilityAPIEnabled
