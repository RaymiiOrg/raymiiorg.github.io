Title       : 	OpenSSL one liner to get expiry date from SSL Certificate of any website

Remember to have the `openssl` package installed. Replace `$IPADRES` with either
the website or the IP address of the site:

    
    
    echo "" | openssl s_client -connect $IPADRES:443 > certexp.crt; openssl x509 -in certexp.crt -noout -enddate
    

For example, this website:

    
    
    echo "" | openssl s_client -connect raymii.org:443 > certexp.crt; openssl x509 -in certexp.crt -noout -enddate
    
    depth=2 C = SE, O = AddTrust AB, OU = AddTrust External TTP Network, CN = AddTrust External CA Root
    verify error:num=19:self signed certificate in certificate chain
    verify return:0
    DONE
    notAfter=Jun 25 23:59:59 2014 GMT

By replacing the last parameter `-enddate` with `-text` you get the full
certificate output. If you use `-subject` you can get the common name.

Example of the `-text` parameter:

    
    
    echo "" | openssl s_client -connect raymii.org:443 > certexp.crt; openssl x509 -in certexp.crt -noout -text
    
    depth=2 C = SE, O = AddTrust AB, OU = AddTrust External TTP Network, CN = AddTrust External CA Root
    verify error:num=19:self signed certificate in certificate chain
    verify return:0
    DONE
