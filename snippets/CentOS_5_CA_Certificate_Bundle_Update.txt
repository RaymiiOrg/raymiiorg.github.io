This simple snippet shows you how to update the root ca certificate bundle on
CentOS 5. Some websites have certificates signed by authorities not in the
default bundle and those websites will not work with tools like git, curl, wget
or anything else that uses https.

When trying to clone a repository from Github on an older CentOS 5 machine I ran
into an SSL certificate verification issue. As it turns out, the Github
certificate was no longer singed by one of the trusted root certificate
authorities in CentOS 5. Therefore I could not clone the repo over https.

The error looks a bit like this:

    
    
    *** error: SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details:
    *** error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed while accessing https://github.com/RaymiiOrg/nopriv.py.git/info/refs
    *** fatal: HTTP request failed
    *** Clone of 'https://github.com/RaymiiOrg/NoPriv.py.git' failed
    

By updating the root ca bundle we can fix this problem. The [cURL website][2]
has a bundle ready that also ships with cURL, and work on CentOS 5.

First, backup the old bundle:

    
    
    cp /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt.bak
    

Then download the new bundle:

    
    
    wget -O /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem
