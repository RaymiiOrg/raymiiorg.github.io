you need to use the following commands (as root or via sudo):

    
    
    scutil --set ComputerName "ChangeMe"
    scutil --set HostName "ChangeMe"
    scutil --set LocalHostName "ChangeMe"

**ComputerName** is the so-called "user-friendly" name for the Mac, it's what
will show up on the Mac itself and what will be visible to others when
connecting to it over a local network. This is also whats visible under the
Sharing preference panel.

**HostName** is the name assigned to the computer as visible from the command
line, and it's also used by local and remote networks when connecting through
SSH and Remote Login.

**LocalHostName** is the name identifier used by Bonjour and visible through
file sharing services like AirDrop
