If you've got a large folder of .flv files (lets say you've ripped them from
youtube) and you want to put them on a music player, you can use this script.

First make a file called `convert.sh`.

    
    
    vim convert.sh
    

Then paste the following in it:

    
    
    #!/bin/bash
    for f in *.flv; do
        echo "Converting $f"
        ffmpeg -i "$f" "${f%.flv}.mp3"
    done
    

Save, and make it executable:

    
    
    chmod +x ./convert.sh
    

Now copy all your FLV's in that folder, and then open a terminal there:

    
    
    ./convert.sh
    

Then, when finished remove all the flv's you copied:

    
    
    rm ./*.flv
    

Now you have a folder full of mp3's instead of .flv's.
