This little snippet joins an Mac OS X computer to a Windows Active Directory or
OpenLDAP Directory domain from the Command Line or via Apple Remote Desktop. It
is tested on OS X 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8 combined with a Windows Server
2003/2008/2012 mixed Active Directory domain and a Fedora 389 DS domain and an
OpenLDAP domain.

    dsconfigad -add DOMAIN.EXT -computer "`hostname -s`" -mobile enable -mobileconfirm disable -username "DOMAIN_ADMIN_USERNAME" -password "DOMAIN_ADMIN_PASSWORD" -ou "CN=Computers,DC=DOMAIN,DC=EXT"
    

The following command also add's users in the "Domain Admins" and "IT_ADM" to
the local Mac OS Admin users. Those users have local administrator rights on the
OS X Machine

    
    
    dsconfigad -groups "DOMAIN\Domain Admins,DOMAIN\IT_ADM"
    

This last command removes the OS X machine from a domain:

    
    
    dsconfigad -remove DOMAIN.EXT -computer "`hostname -s`" -username "DOMAIN_ADMIN_USERNAME" -password "DOMAIN_ADMIN_PASSWORD"
