This is an overview of small operating systems and Linux distributions, most of
them work well on older hardware (pre-dual core era). It provides screenshots,
package information, size and specs and project information on the distro. I've
used all of them myself, except Sky OS. Not all of them are Linux, I also cover
some more exotic operating systems, I like those. But, they have to have a GUI
interface and software to accomplish task with. ([Sorry MikeOS][1]). The list
constist of: Feather Linux, MenuetOS, Sky OS, Damn Small Linux, Tiny Core,
SliTaz GNU/Linux, ReactOS, Haiku, Syllable, AntiX, Puppy and EcomStation2.
