Quoting Ars:

    
    
    The bug, discovered by Stephane Schazelas, is related to how Bash processes environmental variables passed by the operating system or by a program calling a Bash-based script. If Bash has been configured as the default system shell, it can be used by network-based attackers against servers and other Unix and Linux devices via Web requests, secure shell, telnet sessions, or other programs that use Bash to execute scripts.
    

See: for more info.

The simple playbook that fixes it, and adds the Debian 6 LTS repo where needed,
consists out of the following 3 files:

Main role:

    
    
    # cat playbooks/update.yml
     ---
     - hosts: all
       roles:
         - { role: apt-update, when: "ansible_os_family == 'Debian'" }
         - { role: yum-update, when: "ansible_os_family == 'RedHat'" }
    

Debian/Ubuntu Playbook

    
    
     # cat playbooks/roles/apt-update/tasks/main.yml
    
     - copy: src=debian-6-lts.list dest=/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian-6-lts.list
       when: ansible_distribution_major_version == "6"
    
     #  Uncomment the following to test for the vuln.
     #
     # - shell: "export evil='() { :;}; echo vulnerable'; bash -c echo;"
     #  register: result 
    
     # - fail:
     #     msg="Not vulnerable"
     #   when: result.stdout != 'vulnerable'
    
     - apt: name=bash state=latest update_cache=yes
    

Debian 6 LTS repo file:

    
    
     # cat playbooks/roles/apt-update/files/debian-6-lts.list 
    
     # Added by Ansible to fix CVE-2014-6271 (ShellShock)
