I have an Olimex A10 LIME board for which I've made a minimal image, see [this
page for details][2]. It is a very awesome and powerfull ARM dev board with open
source hardware. I like it so much that I decided to also get the A20.

The Olimex A20-LIME2 is the big brother of the A10. The [Olimex Olinuxino A20
LIME2][3], an open source hardware ARM (Allwinner A20) dual core based dev board
with 160 GPIO's, 1,2 GHz/1 GB RAM, 2 USB 2.0 ports, 1 esata port, 1 hdmi port,
USB-OTG, 1 gbit lan (not via the usb bus) and more of those nice features. The
price is even more awesome, the device costs 45 euro's, add 5 euro's and you
have yourself a nice black case. It consumes very little power, combined with
all the features a perfect dev / tinkerboard.

[Olimex][5] sponsored a board for me to create the image, I would like to thank
them very much for them.

The difference with the A10-LIME is the dual core ARM processor, 1 GB of ram
instead of 512 and gigabit networking.

Sadly, the default Debian 7 image suplied by Olimex is bloated and huge. Perfect
for the general tinkerer, has a Desktop Environment and a lot of dev tools and
support for everything. Not perfect for me, I want a small minimal base to start
and add up on that only what I need. This image takes up about 200 MB of space
and uses only around 15 MB of RAM idle.

I took this image and stripped everything out of it, leaving only the bare
minimum. Basically it only runs SSH and allows you to install the tools you need
to build your project, without any other cruft.

It is also more optimized to run off flash storage, by default it has no
logging, no locatedb updates, noatime mount option, this all reducing writes to
the SD card.

The main features / differences from the Olimex provided Debian image (Debian 7
with kernel 3.4.90):

  * Removed `olimex` user
  * Removed all graphical software (x11/desktop etc) (`apt-get purge --auto-remove 'libx11-.*'`)
  * Removed crtmpserver
  * Removed Apache
  * Removed development packages like gcc, perl and python-dev 
  * Removed a lot of kernel modules for things like WiMax, wireless, iscsi etc.
  * Removed other packages like audio and video codecs
  * Removed compiled ffmpeg
  * Removed kernel modules for media and wireless
  * Removed all locales and documentation
  * Replaced openssh by Dropbear (port 22 default)
  * Username/password the same, 'root/olimex'
  * Getty terminals off, only ssh.
  * DHCP enabled on eth0.

The kernel itself is still 3.4, the Debian version is 7 for armhf.

### Instructions

Download the image:

    
    
    wget https://2162bb74000a471eb2839a7f1648771a.objectstore.eu/olimex/a20_debian7_minimal_raymii.img.tar.gz
    

Extract it:

    
    
    tar -xf a20_debian7_minimal_raymii.img.tar.gz
    

Verify the md5 sum:

    
    
    md5 a20_debian7_minimal_raymii.img
    sha256sum a20_debian7_minimal_raymii.img
    

If it is correct, continue. If it is not correct, retry the download.

Plug in your microSD card and use `dmesg` to see which device it is.

Please note that this image is supposed to be on the MicroSD card. I don't know
if and how it works on the eMMC internal flash.

Write the image to the microSD card:

    
    
    dd if=a20_debian7_minimal_raymii.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
    

Afterwards, use a tool like (c)fdisk, parted or gparted to enlarge the second
partition. It is only 500 MB, which is to small to use most of the time.

Plug the microSD card back in and boot the Olimex. It receives an IP address via
DHCP. Check your router, the serial console or use nmap to find it. Log in as
root with the password `olimex`.

If you want to install software, please `apt-get update` first, since the apt-
lists are removed to save +100 MB.

Enjoy!
