Back in 2012, I already [wrote about Tiny Tiny RSS][1]. We're now almost eight 
years later and I still use TT-RSS as my main RSS reader. I'm following almost 
a thousand feeds (944) and it is my main way of reading and discovering stuff 
online. All those personal blogs that post once half a year, mainline tech news
sites and a bunch more sites. Back in 2012 I had 300 feeds, used the Android app. 
Nowdays, more feeds, still use the android app, used an iPhone app for a while
and the server that it runs on has been migrated and upgraded a few times.

[As you might know][2], I also love [plain text][3]. It's the most universal 
storage format, both durable and small. I don't want your nicely designed website,
I want your content. Even worse for Medium.com blogs, or other sites that interrupt
you and are reader-hostile. Cookiewalls, newsletter modals, all those annoyances
are not possible with plain text. 

Which is why on this site, every article is [available as plaintext][2] and also
[via Gopher][4]. [Text News][5] is another example of me trying to make plaintext
available to more people.

I want to share my Tiny Tiny RSS setup with you, which uses the af_readability
plugin. Combined with the Android app, I've got an ideal setup to read just 
the content. 

### Readability

Readability is a term used to describe software that extracts the main content
from a website. It tries to find the text that is the "article" and ignores all
other things like menu's, headers, comments and footers. I use it for [Text News][5]
and tt-rss has a [plugin][6] as well. Or, multiple plugins, there is also FeedIron
and a few other readability options. `af_readability` is built in and shippes 
with tt-rss and works good enough for me.

Compare this, an article without the readability plugin:

![without-readability][7]

with this:

![with-readability][8]


The last screenshot has the readability plugin enabled. I don't have to leave
the app to read the article, I'm not distracted by any web markup or annoyances,
just the content I want.

One annoyance is that you have to enable the plugin on a per-feed setting:

![settings][9]

With almost a thousand feeds that is undoable. But, most feeds I read already
have full text content in their feed, so not a big deal to manually enable it for
a hundred feeds or so.

Another benefit I get is that when I go offline, all the content is synced into
the mobile app. This means that when I sync and are offline but want to read feeds,
I don't have an incomplete feed that requires me to click trough to the website.
