I decided to run my [analyzer][3] over the complete podcast text archive. This
is from episode 001 to 371.

#### Get the files:

    
    
    for i in {001..371}; do curl http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-${i}.txt >> sn.txt; echo $i; done
    

#### Clean the files up:

    
    
    cat sn.txt | LC_CTYPE=C tr -cd '[:alnum:] [:space:]' > csn.txt
    

#### Analyze the text file:

    
    
    cat csn.txt | LC_CTYPE=C tr [:space:] '\n' | grep -v "^\s*$" | sort | uniq -c | sort -bnr > count-combined.txt
    

#### Result:

    
    
    ed count-combined.txt 
    461930
    1,20np
    1       65548 the
    2       49919 to
    3       42284 that
    4       40759 STEVE
