At work I regularly build high-available clusters for customers, where the setup
is distributed over multiple datacenters with failover software. If one
component fails, the service doesn't experience issues or downtime due to the
failure. Recently I was tasked with expanding a cluster setup to be also
reachable via IPv6. This article goes over the settings and configuration
required for haproxy and keepalived for IPv6. The internal cluster will only be
IPv4, the loadbalancer terminates HTTP and HTTPS connections.

### Cluster setup

![cluster][2]

This diagram gives a general idea of the clusters I often build at work. The
CloudVPS network is fully redundant over multiple data centers, so I don't have
to worry about that part. A setup often consist out of the following components
per data center: a loadbalancer, multiple application servers (php, apache,
rails, python, java), a database server (mysql/galera or postgresql). So you
have three loadbalancer, three databaseservers and three or more application
servers in total. Often there are extra components like DRBD/NFS for file
storage, Redis as a key/value store, mongodb or elasticsearch. (All which can be
clustered). Because we have three datacenters there is enough for a quorum.
Sometimes customers choose just two datacenters for cost reasons, then we
explain the issues without quorum and make them sign off the risks in the
contract.

The clusters are IPv4 internally, with keepalived or Corosync/Pacemaker handling
the High Available IP addres (VIP). The loadbalancers all have their own IP and
share one or more external VIP's via the cluster software. They also have a
internal VIP because they function as a gateway for the internal servers. If one
loadbalancer fails, VRRP detects that and the VIP becomes active on one of the
other servers.

For complex setups with depencencies and orders we use Corosync, for example
with DRBD/NFS, so make sure the starting order is correct. First DRBD mount,
then the VIP, then NFS. Most of the time keepalived is enough.

Adding IPv6 is suprisingly easy, so this is a short article covering the
following:

  * IPv6 on the OS
  * keepalived
  * haproxy

The internal network stays the same, the load balancer terminates all traffic
and sends it on over IPv4 to the application servers, which do not need to be
configured with IPv6.

In our case all serves come with a /64 IPv6 natively so there is no network
configuration on switches or routers included in this guide.

### Operating System

The clusters run Ubuntu (16.04) most of the time, so in
`/etc/network/interfaces` there must be an IPv6 address:

    
    
    iface eth0 inet6 static
    address 2a02:123:45:67ab::1/48
    netmask 48
    gateway 2a02:123:45::1
    

This is not the IPv6 address you'll use as the VIP, but a local IPv6 address for
the machine. You don't configure the VIP on the OS.

We have ACL rules on the backend in our hypervisor environment so I added an
extra IPv6 range to the cluster for use with high-availability:

    
    
    2a02:123:45:67bb::1/48
    

(example range in this case, which will be used inside haproxy and keepalived as
IPv6 VIP.)

You also don't need to configure the following sysctl for ipv6:

    
    
    net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1
    

We handle that inside of haproxy and keepalived.

### Keepalived

This is tested with keepalived in ubuntu 16.04, version 1.2.19. Adding the IPv6
address to the `virtual_ipaddress` section and restarting keepalived is enough:

    
    
    vrrp_sync_group VG_1 {
         group {
            EXTERN
            INTERN
         }
    }
    
    vrrp_instance EXTERN {
        interface eth0
        virtual_router_id 12
        state EQUAL
        advert_int 1
        smtp_alert
        notify /usr/local/bin/keepalived-extern.sh
    
        authentication {
            auth_type PASS
            auth_pass hunter2
        }
    
        virtual_ipaddress {
            1.2.3.4/32
            2a02:123:45:67bb::1/32
        }
    }
    

### haproxy

haproxy is suprisingly easy with IPv6. Just add it to your `frontend` section as
a `bind` option:

    
    
    frontend http-in
          mode http
          bind 1.2.3.4:80
          bind 2a02:123:45:67bb::1:80 transparent
          option httplog
          option forwardfor
          option http-server-close
          option httpclose
          reqadd X-Forwarded-Proto:\ http
          http-request add-header X-Real-IP %[src]
          default_backend appserver
    

You must add the `transparant` option. Otherwise, haproxy will not start if the
VIP is not on the machine itself. (kind of like nonlocal.bind sysctl).

haproxy is intelligent enough to understand the port number in the address. No need to screw around with brackets like `[2a02:123:45:67bb::1]:80` or special options.

Restart haproxy and it's configured:

    
    
    netstat -tlpn | grep haproxy
    

Output:

    
    
    tcp        0      0 1.2.3.4:80       0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1163/haproxy
    tcp        0      0 1.2.3.4:443        0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1163/haproxy
    tcp6       0      0 2a02:123:45:67bb::1:80  :::*                    LISTEN      1163/haproxy
    tcp6       0      0 2a02:124:45:67bb::1:443 :::*                    LISTEN      1163/haproxy
    

The version of haproxy is the one from Ubuntu 16.04, 1.6.3.
