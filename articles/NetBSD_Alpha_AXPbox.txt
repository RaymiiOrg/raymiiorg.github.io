> Neofetch running on NetBSD inside AXPbox

This is a guide on installing and running NetBSD 9.2 for the DEC Alpha CPU
architecture on AXPbox, the open source Alpha Emulator. I recently wrote an
article on [how to install NetBSD in QEMU][2] for Alpha and since [I'm involved][3]
with the AXPbox project this article was just a matter of time. This guide
shows you how to compile AXPbox and install NetBSD 9.2. It also shows you 
how to install packages without networking available and includes `openssl`
and `sysbench` benchmarks, which we compare to NetBSD running inside QEMU.

AXPbox runs NetBSD less well than QEMU does, it's a bit slower, enabling
networking or a GUI crashes NetBSD and running with more than 512 MB RAM also
crashes NetBSD during installation. The fun thing however is that the OpenSSL
benchmark, which failed horribly on QEMU, runs well on AXPbox. The big
selling point of AXPbox is that it runs [OpenVMS][1] (QEMU doesn't). NetBSD
and other UNIXes(Tru64) kind of work, but that's more a by-product than an
actual feature.

Comparing `sysbench` benchmarks between QEMU and AXPbox we can see that QEMU
is two to three times faster when running NetBSD.

This guide does not cover X11 / GUI, since there is no networking available.
No networking means that you cannot SSH into the machine and use X11 forwarding.
If in the future networking does work, you can follow the [other guide][2] that
has instructions for VNC or [this guide][4] that covers SSH X11 forwarding. I
did also try the AXPbox [VGA console][5] but as you might have guessed, that
[crashed NetBSD][13].

Package installation is a bit difficult as well since there is no networking.
However, we can work around that by downloading the package files and creating
an ISO file, which can be mounted inside NetBSD. Poor mans file transfer, but 
that way I was able to get sysbench installed. 

Nevertheless, I love the fact that Alpha emulation is so much better then
[it was three years ago][6] when I wrote about it. AXPbox is awesome for 
OpenVMS and the recent QEMU fixes make that great for NetBSD. I love these
developments!


### Compiling and configuring AXPbox


Make sure you have git and a development environment installed. For Ubuntu:

    apt install build-essential git

Clone the AXPbox git repository:

    git clone https://github.com/lenticularis39/axpbox.git

You can also use one of the pre-built release versions, as of writing 1.1.0 is 
the latest. If you do that, skip the build process and continue to the configuration
section.

Create a build folder and compile AXPbox:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" 
    make -j$(($(nproc) + 1))


In your build folder there should now be a binary named `AXPbox`:

    ./axpbox 
    AXPBox Alpha Emulator (commit cba974cdfa4d2b8a459e7c1eb1943fff8b514a09)
    Usage: ../build/axpbox run|configure <options>

Create a `netbsd` folder where the config, ISO and disk are. Not really required, but 
I like to keep my virtualized configs seperated:

    mkdir netbsd
    cd netbsd


Create a folder for the ROM file, which AXPbox needs to boot:

    mkdir rom
    cd rom

Download the SRM rom file:

    wget https://raymii.org/s/inc/downloads/es40-srmon/cl67srmrom.exe
    cd ..

Add the config file for AXPbox. Create or edit `es40.cfg`:

    vim es40.cfg

Paste the following contents:    

    sys0 = tsunami
    {
      memory.bits = 29;
      rom.srm = "rom/cl67srmrom.exe";
      rom.decompressed = "rom/decompressed.rom";
      rom.flash = "rom/flash.rom";
      rom.dpr = "rom/dpr.rom";

      cpu0 = ev68cb
      {
        speed = 1800M;
        icache = false;
        skip_memtest_hack = true;
      }

      serial0 = serial
      {
        port = 21264;
        action = "";
      }

      pci0.15 = ali_ide
      {
      }

      pci0.1 = sym53c810
      {
        disk0.0 = file
        {
          file = "disk.img";
          cdrom = false;
          read_only = false;
        }

        disk0.1 = file
        {
          file = "netbsd.iso"; 
          cdrom = true;
          read_only = true;
        }
      }

      pci0.7 = ali
      {
        mouse.enabled = false;
        vga_console = false;
      }
    }

Last but not least, create an empty disk file where you will install NetBSD onto:

    truncate -s 20G disk.img

I've used 20 GB as size, but less than that will work fine as well. I think
you need 1.5GB for a full NetBSD installation.

Now that the emulator is all set up and ready, continue on to the next section
where we'll start the NetBSD installation.

### Installing NetBSD inside AXPbox

Before we can install NetBSD, we need to download the ISO file. I'm using the
latest current ISO because that was what the QEMU article used, 9.2 should
work just as well.

Check [the following directory][8] for the current version of the latest
`current` ISO, in my case `NetBSD-9.99.88-alpha.iso`. Download the ISO:

    wget -O netbsd.iso https://nycdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-daily/HEAD/latest/images/NetBSD-9.99.88-alpha.iso

Note: If the version number changed, the above command will return a 404 error and you must
specify the new URL yourself.

More information on how the `current` (development/daily) builds work can be
found [here][9] on the NetBSD site.

AXPbox supports booting from the ISO directly, as opposed to QEMU, there 
we had to provide a separate kernel file. 

Once the ISO is downloaded, you can start AXPbox. Make sure you're in
the same folder as the `es40.cfg` file and the NetBSD ISO. In my case
AXPbox is in the `../build` folder, if yours is somewhere else,
adapt the commands accordingly.

    ../build/axpbox run

Open another terminal and connect to the emulator, after which it will continue booting:

    P00>>>


Once you see the `P00>>>` prompt, the fist part of the boot process is finished. Enter
the command `show dev` to see which devices are available:

    P00>>>sho de

Output:

    dka0.0.0.1.0               DKA0                           RZ58  2000
    dka100.1.0.1.0             DKA100                        RRD42  4.5d

If you've configured the disk under the IDE controller, the disk names are different:

    P00>>>sho de
    dqa0.0.0.15.0              DQA0                       disk.img          
    dqa1.1.0.15.0              DQA1                    netbsd .iso          
    dva0.0.0.1000.0            DVA0                               
    ewa0.0.0.4.0               EWA0              08-00-DE-AD-BE-EF
    pka0.7.0.1.0               PKA0                  SCSI Bus ID 7

I found SCSI disks to be more stable and a bit faster when installing, which is why
I'm using those. You can try IDE, it should work fine. Mixing the two could result
in a bug, there is one open in AXPbox regarding copying from an IDE CDROM to a SCSI
disk.

I was testing with networking when I copied this output, which is why you see
a network adapter in the output. That turned out not to work, as you might
have read in the introduction.


Enter the command `boot dka100` to boot from the CDROM drive (with the NetBSD iso):

    P00>>>boot dka100

Output:

Press RETURN to accept the default terminal type. The next thing you should
see is the menu driven installer:



     NetBSD/alpha 9.99.88

     This menu-driven tool is designed to help you install NetBSD to a hard disk,
     or upgrade an existing NetBSD system, with a minimum of work.
     In the following menus type the reference letter (a, b, c, ...) to select an
     item, or type CTRL+N/CTRL+P to select the next/previous item.
     The arrow keys and Page-up/Page-down may also work.
     Activate the current selection from the menu by typing the enter key.

I'm not going to cover the entire installation process, that would give
an enormous amount of output. It's a minimal install with default 
partitioning. No network configured, no X11. 

I'll highlight the steps with some output, but the installer is 
so straight forward that you should be able to figure it out.

Select `>a: Install NetBSD to hard disk` to continue.

Choose the only available disk (`sd0`):

Select the default partitioning:

     You can use a simple editor to set the sizes of the NetBSD partitions, or
     apply the default partition sizes and contents.

     You will then be given the opportunity to change any of the partition
     details.                 
                              
     The NetBSD (or free) part of your disk (sd0) is 20G.
                              
     A full installation requires at least 1156M without X and at least 1456M if
     the X sets are included.

Review the options and select `OK`:


     We now have your disklabel partitions for sd0 below.  This is your last

Select the `Minimal Installation` option. In my case the other ones failed
with error messages regarding `no space left on device`. The `Install From` 
location is `CD-ROM / DVD`.

Once prompted `Hit ENTER to continue`, do so. The basic installation is complete and you
can now configure a few options. 

I choose to leave all the options on their default. We're not configuring networking, 
so no `ssh`. If you want you can set a root password. 

     Configure the additional items as needed.

     o: Add a user
     x: Finished configuring


Choose `x: Finished configuring`, press ENTER a few more times and exit the
installer. Shutdown the system with the command `shutdown -h now` and in
your other terminal, where AXPbox runs, exit that by pressing CTRL+C.

The installation is now finished. 

### NetBSD startup


Fire up AXPbox again and open a telnet session in another terminal, just as
you did when installing NetBSD. There are two things different as to when installing,
the first is setting a boot flag to boot in to multiuser mode and the second is a 
different boot device. 

![bootflags][7]

The SRM firmware has the concept of boot flags, which are different for each 
type of operating system. For Tru64 (unix) and thus for NetBSD, by default
the system will boot to single user mode, unless we give it a specific flag. 
I've included an image with the different supported flags, taken from the SRM
reference manual for an actual AlphaServer. You can check out my [OpenVMS guide][1]
to read more about what the flags mean for OpenVMS.

On the `P00>>>` prompt, enter the following command:

    P00>>>set boot_osflags a


You only need to do this once. Next time you fire up AXPbox, the flag will
be remembered. 

Boot from the freshly installed NetBSD disk:

    P00>>>boot dka0

Output:

    (boot dka0.0.0.1.0 -flags a)
    block 0 of dka0.0.0.1.0 is a valid boot block

Yay! NetBSD again. I'm always excited when you reach such a point, like an OS booting. 
When you think about all the layers of emulation inbetween, it's amazing!

    NetBSD 9.99.88 (GENERIC) #0: Sun Aug 15 22:22:52 UTC 2021

    Welcome to NetBSD!

    This is a development snapshot of NetBSD for testing -- user beware!

    Bug reports: https://www.NetBSD.org/support/send-pr.html
    Donations to the NetBSD Foundation: https://www.NetBSD.org/donations/
    We recommend that you create a non-root account and use su(1) for root access.
    netbsd# 


Now the system is all yours to play with. This article covers package installation via
an ISO file and some crashes I had, but if you know your way around NetBSD you can stop
here.

Some system information:

    netbsd# uname -a
    NetBSD netbsd.spnw.nl 9.99.88 NetBSD 9.99.88 (GENERIC) #0: Sun Aug 15 22:22:52 UTC 2021  mkrepro@mkrepro.NetBSD.org:/usr/src/sys/arch/alpha/compile/GENERIC alpha

It's not possible to see what kind of CPU NetBSD thinks there is:


    netbsd# cat /proc/cpuinfo 
    netbsd# cpuctl identify 0
    CPU identification not implemented for this architecture.

`dmesg` output does have some info:

    netbsd# dmesg | grep MHz
    [     1.000000] AlphaServer ES40, 1785MHz, s/n 


In the QEMU guide, that output was:

    6600 family, unknown model variation 0x1400, 250MHz, s/n QEMU


To speed up the system, you can disable a few services in `/etc/rc.conf`:

    sshd=NO
    inetd=NO
    postfix=NO
    cron=NO
    syslogd=NO


Networking does not work, so `postfix`, `inetd` and `sshd` are not needed.
`inetd` starts services once you connect to a port, but we can't do that 
when we have no network. Postfix is for email, which is quite useless without 
network.

`cron` and `syslogd` could be useful, but disk IO is not fast, so disabling them
speeds up the system a noticeable amount.


#### Autoboot NetBSD via SRM

As I showed in the OpenVMS guide, with the below SRM commands you can make
AXPbox boot into NetBSD by default, that way you don't have to type
the `boot dka0` command each time you fire up AXPbox.

    P00>>>set auto_action boot 
    P00>>>set bootdef_dev dka0

You cannot undo those commands, or at least I haven't found out how. 

### Installing packages

Since we have no network, we cannot use `pkgin` or `fetch` or 
`ftp` to download packages. A trick I used in the OpenVMS 
install guide to install the OpenVMS license was to create 
an ISO file on the host OS (where you run AXPbox) and mount
that ISO file inside the virtualized OS (OpenVMS in that case),
transferring the file that way.

That trick also works with NetBSD. I'm going to show you how
to install the `sysbench` package, because that is a simple
package without dependencies. Start by creating a folder 
for the packages:

    mkdir pkg
    cd pkg

Download the package:

    wget https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/alpha/9.2/All/sysbench-0.4.12nb8.tgz

Go up one folder:

    cd ..

Turn that folder into an ISO file:    

    genisoimage -V pkg -o pkg.iso pkg/

Output:

Make sure AXPbox is not running. Edit `es40.cfg` and replace the `netbsd.iso`
filename with our new ISO: `pkg.iso`:

    disk0.1 = file
    {
      file = "pkg.iso"; 
      cdrom = true;
      read_only = true;
    }

Fire up AXPbox and boot into NetBSD. Once logged in, mount the ISO file:


    netbsd# mount /dev/cd0a /mnt

Output:

    [ 1092.6207707] cd0: no disk label
    [ 1092.6246875] cd0: no disk label
    [ 1092.7029975] cd0: no disk label

In `/mnt` you should now see the package we put on the ISO:

    netbsd# ls -la /mnt

Output:

    total 59
    dr-xr-xr-x   1 root  wheel   2048 Aug 27 06:49 .
    drwxr-xr-x  20 root  wheel    512 Aug 26 16:05 ..
    -r-xr-xr-x   1 root  wheel  56803 Jul 16 11:27 sysbench.tgz


Install the package:

    netbsd# pkg_add /mnt/sysbench.tgz 

Output:

    pkg_add: Warning: package `sysbench-0.4.12nb8' was built for a platform:
    pkg_add: NetBSD/alpha 9.0 (pkg) vs. NetBSD/alpha 9.99.88 (this host)


You can repeat this process for as many packages as you want. It becomes a
bit more difficult when you have dependencies, as you need to manually install
those in the correct order. This is the output I got when installing `screenfetch`:

    pkg_add: Warning: package `screenfetch-3.9.1' was built for a platform:
    pkg_add: NetBSD/alpha 9.0 (pkg) vs. NetBSD/alpha 9.99.88 (this host)
    pkg_add: no pkg found for 'curl-[0-9]*', sorry.
    pkg_add: Can't install dependency curl-[0-9]*
    pkg_add: Expected dependency curl-[0-9]* still missing
    pkg_add: 1 package addition failed

The `curl` package depends on `libidn` and so forth, it took a while to get
`screenfetch` installed.

You do not have to reboot AXPbox every time you update the ISO. Unmount it 
in NetBSD (`umount /mnt`), add a package to the `pkg` folder and re-issue
the `genisoimage` command. Mount the disk in NetBSD and you should see the 
new package. I'm not sure if this is intended, but as far as I tested it,
it seems to work. If you do get weird errors, reboot netbsd or terminate and 
restart AXPbox to make sure the ISO file is re-read.

### OpenSSL Benchmark            

In [the QEMU][2] article I also posted some benchmarks, both OpenSSL 
and `sysbench`. `OpenSSL speed` failed horribly on QEMU, overflowing
numbers, no output or `infinity`. On AXPbox however, the benchmark
runs fine. 

[This article][10] has some benchmarks on Debian 5.0 on QEMU Alpha, including
`OpenSSL speed`. [EmuVM][11] has a few benchmarks as well, both real Alpha
machines as their commercial emulator. Most of the other benchmarks do not
run on NetBSD (Only OpenVMS or Tru64), so reproducing that is hard. OpenSSL
however, is included on NetBSD by default. Newer version, but hopefully
comparable results.

`OpenSSL speed` is a performance benchmark for each of the available
algorithms. Because this is an old CPU architecture, and because [the other
article][10] does so (as well as [EmuVM][11]), I'm trying just the `md5` and
`rsa` benchmarks. 

Here are the results for RSA:

    netbsd# openssl speed rsa

The NetBSD version is exactly the same as with QEMU, so it seems unlikely
that the issue with QEMU is in OpenSSL or NetBSD. Which is weird because
[the other article][11] runs the same commands that do work in Debian 5.0.

                   
### sysbench

In the earlier section we installed the `sysbench` package. Sysbench is quite
a populair cross platform benchmarking tool and it even gave reasonable
results, as opposed to OpenSSL. It's an older version, currently we're at
sysbench 1.0.20 and NetBSD has 0.4.12. 

Here are the results, the tests are the same as in the [QEMU article][2].

### Comparing AXPbox and QEMU benchmarks

Comparing the results to QEMU is interesting. Summarized below are the AXPbox results:

    CPU: total number of events: 19
    Memory: 447.07 MB transferred (7.45 MB/sec)
    Disk: Operations performed:  0 Read, 37353 Write, 0 Other = 37353 Total
    Read 0b  Written 583.64Mb  Total transferred 583.64Mb  (9.7263Mb/sec)
      622.48 Requests/sec executed

These are the QEMU results, running on the same host machine and the same NetBSD version:

    CPU: total number of events: 532
    Memory: 1228.18 MB transferred (20.47 MB/sec)
    Disk: Operations performed:  0 Read, 131072 Write, 8 Other = 131080 Total
    Read 0b  Written 2Gb  Total transferred 2Gb  (34.332Mb/sec)
     2197.25 Requests/sec executed

The emulation provided by QEMU seems to be faster by a large amount, on all three
tests. This is a basic benchmark and we have to keep in mind that both emulators
emulate different hardware and that the core code of AXPbox is over 10 years old.


### Kernel error too much memory

If you boot the installer more than 512 MB of RAM (`memory.bits > 29;`), the
installation will crash during formatting the disk. The disk size does not
matter, I tried it with 500MB, 1 GB, 2 GB, 5 GB, 10 GB and 20 GB disk files.
Default partitioning sizes. Here's the output of the installer:


         Status: Command ended on signal

### Kernel error with networking

AXPbox supports networking, which works reasonably well with OpenVMS. This is the part
you put in your config to enable it:

      pci0.4 = dec21143 
      {
        adapter = "eth0"; 
        mac = "08-00-DE-AD-BE-EF"; 
      }

The NetBSD installer sees the adapter and allows you to configure it:


     Which network device would you like to use?

                              +-------------------------+
     
     
 
 
I choose autoselect the first time:

     To be able to use the network, we need answers to the following:

     Network media type [autoselect]:

It kept hanging on DHCP requests with error messages from `dmesg` inbetween:

### Kernel error with AXPBox VGA Graphics 

![crash][13]

Configuring AXPbox to use the graphics console [as per the documentation][5] 
sadly also crashed NetBSD as the above screenshot shows. Both `cirrus` as
`s3` crash the system with the same kind of error message.

If in the future these errors get fixed, I'll update the guide accordingly.
