Twitter recently started monitoring everything logged in users do on the web so
that they can get "more relevant" followers. Facebook does this for a long time
nowdays via their like buttons (even non-logged in users) and I think google
also has a big share in this. I don't like that, so I try to block it mostly.
The purpose of this article is to inform you about chrome extensions that help
you block these things. (I'm not going in to the fact that chrome is a google
product, who knows how they monitor me that way. I btw use chromium, the open-
source version, but this all should also work on the normal chrome) So lets kick
off! I want to note that there are some extensions that are doing the same
thing. I do not think it is bad for chrome, I've not noticed any stupid side-
effects of it.

### Adblock for Chrome

![][2]

AdBlock blocks all advertisements, and it has no configuration. I've whitelisted
a lot of open source related websites, but most of the sites have huge and
disturbing ads which I absolutely hate. [LINK][3]

### Disconnect

![][4]

Disconnect blocks tracking by sites like Digg, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo and
Google. It also depersonalizes searches by disabling identifying cookies and you
can see in real time what is blocked and what not. [LINK][5]

### Facebook Disconnect

![][6]

Does what the name says, blocks all third-party traffic to facebook, but lets
you use facebook normally. [ LINK][7]

### Do Not Track Plus

![][8]

Also a tracking blocker. Has a lot of options, but the GUI config seems a little
cluttered to me. You need to read some things two times, but it works. [LINK][9]

### Ghostery

![][10]

This is a nice one. Also block a lot of things, but was started as an
informative tool. It has a nice alert bubble (which can be turned off) to show
you how you are tracked on the websites you visit. Has a special feature,
Ghostrank, to collect anonymous data on which websites track you with what.

### Google Analytics Opt-out (by Google)

![][12]

This is an official google extension, simply blocks the google analytics
service. No other statistic services, just google. I mainly use this so that my
own visits to my websites are not counted in analytics. [ LINK][13]

### ScriptNo

![][14]

**This is IMHO the most important one. It is like the firefox NoScript, and it
lets you block all, some or no javascript, on a per site basis. It is really
awesome. I cannot say anything else of it, it just works great. Does exactly
what it says, and it does it very well.** [ LINK][15]

### HTTPS Everywhere

![https-everywhere][16]

This is also an important one, it helps you use HTTPS on a lot of websites. Just
so that you are less likely to get a man-in-the-middle attack. I used to use KB
SSL Enforcer, but that sometimes gives errors on websites that have no SSL site,
but do have SSL enabled. (a lot of PLESK websites have that.) Just install and
forget about it, but you are more safer on public wifi, or other networks where
you may be monitored. [ LINK][17]

### MVPS Hosts file

[ LINK][18]. This is what I used before the handy ad block extensions. It blocks
ads, and a lot of unsafe and malicious websites. It is a little more tricky to
setup, but for the Win platform they provide a nice .bat script. On a Linux
platform you have to add the contents to the _/etc/hosts_ file.
