This is a guide on installing and running NetBSD for the Alpha CPU architecture on
QEMU, including a GUI (X11 via VNC). It requires you to patch
and compile QEMU yourself. It was never possible, until now, to run
an actual operating system *easily* with QEMU Alpha, so this is amazing! 
It is very cool that [Jason Thorpe][2] is putting in [so much effort
on the QEMU side][29], as all but one patch is upstream already. Alpha emulation
has always been a niche of a niche, so seeing this improve in QEMU is wonderful.
OpenVMS does not boot yet since many more things are missing on the QEMU side,
but who knows what the future might bring? Maybe even Windows NT for Alpha will
boot on QEMU one day?

This article is based on [work][3] by [astr0baby][4]/[DoktorCranium][5] and
his twitter screenshots. His guide is quite sparse, which I try to improve
with this one. [astr0baby][4] does a lot of cool emulation stuff, his twitter
is full of screenshots of his M1 Macbook running all kinds of legacy
operating systems, from AIX to OpenVMS to MorphOS on whatever old CPU you can
think of.


Here is how the end result of this guide looks:

![openttd][31]

> Modern OpenTTD and browsing on NetBSD on Alpha! 

If you're interested in Alpha emulation or running OpenVMS, check out [AXPbox][6]
or read [this page][10] for more information on available emulators. AXPbox
[can boot][12] the NetBSD 9.1 installer, but it doesn't install yet, due to disk
emulation issues. If you get it working with 9.2 or the current NetBSD development release,
please let me know!

There were earlier attempts to use QEMU Alpha emulation, [here is a guide from
2014 on running Debian][27]. However, Debian [dropped the Alpha architecture]
[28] after version 5.0 (lenny), so NetBSD is our only modern option. And
maybe Gentoo, but I'm unsure of that. Tru64 will not run on QEMU currently. 

The Alpha machine QEMU emulates is based on the Alpha DP264 platform, this is
probably best known as the basis of the Compaq AlphaServer ES40 and Compaq
AlphaStation ES40 systems, although a number of other AlphaStations
(e.g. XP900 and XP1000), AlphaServers (e.g. DS10 and DS20) and OEM boards
(e.g. AlphaPC 264DP and API UP2000) were also based on it. ([via][30])

I can't even do a `cat /proc/cpuinfo`. The NetBSD specific
`cpuctl identify 0` command reports `CPU identification not implemented for
this architecture`. With `dmesg` you get some info, but not much:  

    dmesg | grep MHz
    [     1.000000] 6600 family, unknown model variation 0x1400, 250MHz, s/n QEMU


Here's a screenshot of NeoFetch in the QEMU console:

![neofetch][41]


This guide is also available for [AXPbox][40], the other open source DEC
Alpha emulator.

* 2021-08-19: Added a few responses from Jason's mailing list answer regarding kernel / emulation.

### Patching and building QEMU

Due to not all patches [being upstream][2] you must build QEMU yourself. This process
is rather simple, as you would expect it is nothing more than getting the source code,
applying the patch and the regular `./configure` followed by `make`. To install all
required build dependencies on Ubuntu, use the following command:

    apt-get build-dep qemu

The patch file is rather small, which is why I can share it here. Place the below
contents in a file named `alpha-mmclock-qemu.patch`:

         check_update_timer(s);

The manual process to build and install QEMU from the latest release is on
[the official site][7]. You can keep an eye on [the source file mx146818rtc.c
git log][1] to see if the patch process is still required. As of writing this
article, it is, the latest commit there is `2021-05-13 Philippe Mathieu...
hw/rtc/mc146818rtc: Convert to 3-phase reset (Resettabl...)
(fae5a0420754453beca3407250899254fb6745a1)`. I'm building git commit hash
`bd44d64a3879bb6b0ca19bff3be16e0093502fac`, but if you notice that the git
log of the above file is different, skip the patch/checkout step and let me
know if I need to update this article.

Clone the QEMU source repository:

    git clone https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu.git

Navigate into the source folder:

    cd qemu

Checkout the specific commit I used when writing this article:

    git checkout bd44d64a3879bb6b0ca19bff3be16e0093502fac

Apply the patch:

    patch -p1 < alpha-mmclock-qemu.patch 

Output should look like:

    patching file hw/rtc/mc146818rtc.c
    Hunk #2 succeeded at 934 (offset -16 lines).

Initialize all git submodules:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update --recursive

Start the actual build process, first the configure step, for speed of 
compilation specifically for the Alpha architecture only:

    ./configure --target-list=alpha-softmmu 

Followed by make to start compilation. Replace `-j8` with your amount of CPU cores:

    make -j8

No `make install`, since I suspect you already have qemu installed and just
want to test out stuff. This build, due to being configured with a 
specific target, will only work with that, not "regular" QEMU as 
provided by your distro.

Make will take some time, when it is finished compiling, you should
have a binary named `qemu-system-alpha` inside the `build` folder:

    file build/qemu-system-alpha

Output:

    build/qemu-system-alpha: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1
    (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2,
    BuildID[sha1]=bc41c3dfc1d574362343dbe4f8d06ad1f72806a6, for GNU/Linux
    4.4.0, with debug_info, not stripped

If you run the binary, you should see a black window with a green text
greeting you (`Hello`):

![screenshot qemu][11]

I had some configure errors (for example `ERROR:
Program 'keycodemapdb/tools/keymap-gen' not found`) that were the result of
the `git submodule update` command failing. I had to reset all submodules and
try again with the following commands:

    git clean -xfd
    git submodule foreach --recursive git clean -xfd
    git reset --hard
    git submodule foreach --recursive git reset --hard
    git submodule update --init --recursive

### Installing NetBSD

The installation process runs as usual once it's booted up. You use an
interactive installer to install NetBSD, but to boot, we must provide the
kernel to QEMU  manually. The kernel file for installation is different from
the one for "regular" use. 

#### Downloading the ISO and kernels

Check [the following directory][8] for the current version of the latest
`current` ISO, in my case `NetBSD-9.99.88-alpha.iso`. Download the ISO:

    wget https://nycdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-daily/HEAD/latest/images/NetBSD-9.99.88-alpha.iso

Note: If the version number changed, the above command will return a 404 error and you must
specify the new URL yourself.

More information on how the `current` (development/daily) builds work can be
found [here][9] on the NetBSD site.

I asked on [the mailing list][35] why the kernels should be provided to QEMU
outside of the installed disk, this is what Jason had to say:

> The Qemu "bios" (palcode-clipper) for its Alpha emulation does not contain
  any of the I/O callbacks implemented by real DEC SRM firmware.  Nor does it
  contain any of the CLI implemented by real DEC SRM firmware.  As such,
  there is no way to use a boot loader program to load the kernel from the
  file system in the emulated machines disks.

Download the two kernel files, start with the one for installation:

    wget http://nycdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-daily/HEAD/latest/alpha/installation/instkernel/netbsd.gz

Uncompress it and rename so we know which one is which:

    gunzip netbsd.gz
    mv netbsd inst-netbsd

My file is for 9.99.88, yours may differ:

    file inst-netbsd

Output:

    inst-netbsd: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, Alpha (unofficial), version 1
    (SYSV), statically linked, for NetBSD 9.99.88, stripped

Same for the one for regular use:

    wget http://nycdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-daily/HEAD/latest/alpha/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC.QEMU.gz 

Extract it:
    
    gunzip netbsd-GENERIC.QEMU.gz 

File information:

    netbsd-GENERIC.QEMU: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, Alpha(unofficial), version
    1 (SYSV), statically linked, for NetBSD 9.99.88, not stripped

I asked what the difference is between the installation kernel and the regular
QEMU kernel file on the mailing list:

> GENERIC.QEMU is exactly the same as GENERIC except that it has the kernel
  symbol table injected into it for use by the in-kernel debugger
  (and, eventually, the in-kernel linker for modules, once I finish
  implementing all of the necessary relocations for Alpha). 



#### NetBSD Installation

Create a disk file which the installation will use:

    qemu-img create -f qcow2 disk.img 20G 

Start QEMU with the following command to start the installation:

    ./build/qemu-system-alpha \
    -m 1024 \
    -kernel inst-netbsd \
    -drive file=disk.img,media=disk,format=qcow2,index=0 \
    -drive file=NetBSD-9.99.88-alpha.iso,media=cdrom,format=raw,index=1 \
    -net nic \
    -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 

Change the ISO filename if the version number has changed upstream
(`NetBSD-9.99.88-alpha.iso`).

If you haven't applied the patch, the install will boot but hang with an error
regarding the clock:

![screenshot rtc error][13]

Otherwise, you will be asked what type of terminal you're using and the
installation will start as you're used to:

![screenshot installer][14]

Continue on with the interactive installer. I'm not covering the entire
installation process since there are no special things you need to do
(like the qemu patch above).

![screenshot installer][15]

I choose a full installation (not minimal or without X11), installed to disk `wd0`
using the CDROM as source:

![screenshot installer][16]


I also setup networking during the installation, as well as enable SSH and mdns:

![screenshot installer][17]

Here's the summary:

![screenshot installer][18]

Once you're done installing, shut down the VM with the following command:

    shutdown -p now

### Running NetBSD

Once NetBSD is installed, the command to start qemu is different, since we're using a 
different kernel file and we're telling NetBSD which drive to boot from (`wd0`). 

This is the new command:

    ./build/qemu-system-alpha \
    -m 1024 \
    -kernel netbsd-GENERIC.QEMU \
    -drive file=disk.img,media=disk,format=qcow2,index=0 \
    -drive file=NetBSD-9.99.88-alpha.iso,media=cdrom,format=raw,index=1 \
    -append "rootdev=/dev/wd0" \
    -net nic \
    -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22

If you do get questions asked during boot, just press ENTER to accept the defaults. 

If all went well, you should be able to login to your fresh new shiny Alpha NetBSD:

![screenshot netbsd][19]

Networking works out of the box as well:

![screenshot netbsd][20]

Awesome, well done. For the final part, we're going to install and setup
TigerVNC so we can play around with a GUI.

#### Connecting via SSH to NetBSD

The QEMU VM is started with the option `-net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22`. This
means that on you local machine, port `2222` is forwarded to port `22` on the
VM. To SSH into the NetBSD machine (assuming networking is setup and
working), you can connect to that port on localhost:

    ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 2222

I had to allow root login (`vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config`, `PermitRootLogin yes`,
`service sshd restart`), which in this case, for this local test machine not
directly exposed to the internet, is not a security risk.

![SSH][25]

If you're unable to install packages (for whatever reason), you can use the
built-in features to have a GUI via SSH and Xnest. See [my other article]
[38] how to do that.


### Setup X11 and VNC (GUI) 

X is installed by default, but crashes with a segfault if [you run it][33] on
the QEMU VGA console (`X -configure`, then `X -config /root/xorg.conf.new`).
Therefore, we're going to use VNC, which does run and is quite fast and
usable. The `tigervnc` server is not included in the installation, which is
why we start with setting up the package manager and installing a few
packages.

A screenshot of the segfault:

![x11 crash][23]

#### Installing binary packages (pkgsrc)

Assuming networking works, we can use [the usual way][32] to install
binary packages. How amazing it is that NetBSD provides binary packages
for Alpha, compiling them would otherwise take very long.

Type the following commands in the shell to install the binary package manager:

    PATH="/usr/pkg/sbin:/usr/pkg/bin:$PATH"
    PKG_PATH="https://cdn.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages"
    PKG_PATH="$PKG_PATH/NetBSD/alpha/9.2/All/"
    export PATH PKG_PATH
    pkg_add pkgin

Update the package sources:

    pkgin update

After that, you can install tigervnc:

    pkgin install tigervnc    


**When writing this article, there was an issue with the repository, the index
  file was corrupt. The below section covers that, but you can probably skip
  it if you're not interested in NetBSD's packaging system. You can continue
  with the section `TigerVNC Configuration`. After sending a message on the
  `port-alpha` mailing list, [John fixed the repository][36].**

In my case, `pkgin update` gave an error, `pkgin: Short read of pkg_summary: truncated
bzip2 input`. This seems to be a [corrupt file][21], which I cannot fix from
here. I did however saw on the directory index, that there also was a gzipped
version (not bzip2), `pkg_summary.gz`, but I could not find a way to get
that file instead of the bzip2 file. 

`pkgin` is a handy wrapper that mimicks `apt/yum`, but underneath it uses
`pkg_*`, as far as I know, which we can also do manually. The repository URL
is setup after we've exported the variables earlier, so you should be able to
just do:

    pkg_add fetch

You can also specify the entire URL to a package:

    pkg_add ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/alpha/9.2/All/fetch-1.9nb1.tgz    

For the exact filename you can [browse the web index of Alpha packages][22]. 

You can also use `ftp` to download the package, then install it locally:

    ftp -i ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/alpha/9.2/All/fetch-1.9nb1.tgz
    pkg_add ./fetch-1.9nb1.tgz

That will however still connect to the network to fetch dependencies, so if
you're doing this offline (lets say via an NFS share), you might run into
issues there. 

Install the `tigervnc` package:

    pkg_add tigervnc

It will fetch some dependencies and should install correctly:

![vnc install][24]

### TigerVNC configuration

Configuring tigerVNC is simple since most configuration is already 
done via the package. Start by setting up a VNC password:

    vncpasswd

Enter the password twice:

    Password:
    Verify:

Answer no to a view only password:

    Would you like to enter a view-only password (y/n)? n

Start the VNC server:

    vncserver

Output:

    New 'netbsd.alpha.raymii.org:1 (root)' desktop is netbsd.alpha.raymii.org:1

    Creating default startup script /root/.vnc/xstartup
    Creating default config /root/.vnc/config
    Starting applications specified in /root/.vnc/xstartup
    Log file is /root/.vnc/netbsd.alpha.raymii.org:1.log

To connect to your shiny new awesome desktop, you must use SSH to forward a
port. Disconnect your SSH session and reconnect with a new flag for a local
port forward:

    ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 2222 -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901

This forwards port 5901 (VNC port for display `:1`) on your local machine to
port `5901` on the virtual machine. After logging in, you should be able to
use any VNC client to connect right away:

![vnc yay][26]

How cool is that? A modern NetBSD with a graphical desktop on a CPU
architecture (Alpha) running in QEMU, with networking. 

After rebooting, you need to enter the `vncserver` command again to start
VNC. You can also setup a service to autostart at boot, but I'm not going 
to cover how to do that in this guide. You've gotten this far on a weird
CPU emulation article, I bet you that you're very capable of figuring
autostarting VNC out yourself.

For some more fun, you can install a browser (`netsurf` or `dillo`, firefox or
chrome are not available as packages) or a game (my favorite, `openttd` is
available as a package including the free graphics `openttd-data`). OpenTTD
is quite playable. Not very fast, but a small map seems to run okay.

It even seems `xfce4` packages are available in the repository, so you could deck out
a full featured desktop. I've tried installing it, but after 18 hours or so, it's 
still running. Netsurf took just as long, and it seems to be the installation
of GTK that takes so much time. As Jason says on the mailing list, it might be 
related to disk IO:

> Yikes.  I'll need pkg install experts to weigh in on this.  It's entirely
  possible that it's bottlenecked on the disk emulation.  I'm working on
  getting VirtIO to work on alpha so hopefully we can speed disk and network
  access up a little.

If there is any software you do want to run but not available as a binary
package, compiling it yourself (or letting `pkgsrc` do it for you) is always
an option.


![openttd][31]


I managed to compile `python2` via `pkgsrc`, the `cvs checkout` of `pkgsrc`
took a day or so to complete:

![python2][37]

The setup of `pkgsrc` for source compilation is documented on the NetBSD website
but this is the process I used, if you want to try it out:

    cd /usr && cvs -q -z2 -d anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot checkout -r pkgsrc-2021Q1 -P pkgsrc
    cd /usr/pkgsrc/lang/python27
    make fetch-list | sh; # fetch dependencies
    make NO_CHECKSUM=yes 
    make install


If you get any segfaults or `internal compiler errors` during building, my
experience is that those go away if you retry the build. (Do a `make clean` first). 
Below is an example error message, which did not occur when I retried the compilation:

    mv -f .deps/loadapi.Tpo .deps/loadapi.Po

### OpenSSL Speed Benchmark

[This article][30] has some benchmarks on Debian 5.0 on QEMU Alpha, including
`OpenSSL speed`. [EmuVM][39] has a few benchmarks as well, both real Alpha
machines as their commercial emulator. Most of the other benchmarks do not
run on NetBSD (Only OpenVMS or Tru64), so reproducing that is hard. OpenSSL
however, is included on NetBSD by default. Newer version, but hopefully
comparable results.

`OpenSSL speed` is a performance benchmark for each of the available
algorithms. Because this is an old CPU architecture, and because [the other
article][30] does so (as well as [EmuVM][39]), I'm trying just the `md5` and
`rsa` benchmarks. 

**The OpenSSL benchmark fails**. Results overflow on the RSA side and MD5
doesn't give any numbers. Not sure if this is an emulation issue, or a
NetBSD issue. Might also be in OpenSSL, it's quite a new version(1.1.1) and
I'm not sure if the OpenSSL project still tests on Alpha machines.  I'm
including the results, for future reference it might be interesting. For
comparison however, they are useless.

I did try to play with some options (longer runtime, `-elapsed` flag
(`Use wall-clock time instead of CPU user time as divisor`) but none 
helped. The weird thing is that these two commands work fine on [AXPbox with NetBSD][40],
which makes me suspect that there is an issue with QEMU emulation as opposed to
an issue in OpenSSL. The other article has OpenSSL results from Debian 5.0, 
so it might be a combination of this OpenSSL version with QEMU, but I'm not sure.

### SysBench benchmark

The [NetBSD Alpha][22] package repository does have a `sysbench` package. 
Sysbench is quite a populair cross platform benchmarking tool and it even
gave reasonable results, as opposed to OpenSSL. It's an older version, 
currently we're at sysbench 1.0.20 and NetBSD has 0.4.12.

A 30 second timeout failed the test, which is why the max time for memory is 60.

The default number of files (128) failed with an error message, too many open
files, which is why I tried with 8.

Comparing the results to AXPbox is interesting. Summarized below are the AXPbox results:

    CPU: total number of events: 19
    Memory: 447.07 MB transferred (7.45 MB/sec)
    Disk: Operations performed:  0 Read, 37353 Write, 0 Other = 37353 Total
    Read 0b  Written 583.64Mb  Total transferred 583.64Mb  (9.7263Mb/sec)
      622.48 Requests/sec executed

These are the QEMU results, running on the same host machine and the same NetBSD version:

    CPU: total number of events: 532
    Memory: 1228.18 MB transferred (20.47 MB/sec)
    Disk: Operations performed:  0 Read, 131072 Write, 8 Other = 131080 Total
    Read 0b  Written 2Gb  Total transferred 2Gb  (34.332Mb/sec)
     2197.25 Requests/sec executed

The emulation provided by QEMU seems to be faster by a large amount, on all three
tests. This is a basic benchmark and we have to keep in mind that both emulators
emulate different hardware and that the core code of AXPbox is over 10 years old.

A comparison with the machine that runs the QEMU VM (x86, Intel i7-8750H):

    $ sysbench --test=cpu run --max-time=30
    WARNING: the --test option is deprecated. You can pass a script name or path on the command line without any options.
    WARNING: --max-time is deprecated, use --time instead
    sysbench 1.0.20 (using system LuaJIT 2.0.5)
