### Tiny Tiny RSS - The best Free and Open Source alternative to Google Reader

![TinyTinyRSS][1]

This is an article about [Tiny Tiny RSS][2]. Tiny Tiny RSS is an open source
web-based news feed (RSS/Atom) reader and aggregator, designed to allow you to
read news from any location, while feeling as close to a real desktop
application as possible. I will go over the features of TIny Tiny RSS, compare
it to Google Reader and write some things I like about it, and things I miss
about it.

##### Features of Tiny Tiny RSS

  * Server-side application, user only needs a web browser 
  * Client side SSL certificate based login
  * Supports RSS, RDF and Atom feeds using Magpie and SimplePie libraries 
  * Easy setup and configuration 
  * Streamlined interface using AJAX Free software, licensed under GNU GPL 
  * Authentication for reading protected feeds (e.g. LiveJournal friend-only posts)
  * Feed aggregation 
  * Keyboard shortcuts 
  * OPML import/export 
  * Multiple and single user operation 
  * Mobile devices 
  * Internationalization 
  * Detecting and filtering duplicate articles 
  * Podcasts
  * Article scoring 
  * Content filtering 
  * JSON-based API 
  * Twitter feeds
  * Feed sharing between instances

##### Requirements

On the desktop/client side you only need a modern web browser with a bit of
HTML5 support.  
On the server side you need a webserver which supports PHP 5.2 or higher and a
MySQL database. On the website they do not recommend to install it on shared
hosting, but I run it on a shared (cpanel) webhosting account (over at [Secure
Dragon][4] and it runs great, fast and SecureDragon did not complain yet. Their
overall service is great, so if you need shared hosting I vouch for them).

##### Android Client

![Android Client][5]

I always used Google Reader on my android devices, but I've discovered the Tiny
Tiny RSS mobile app. It is very good, and it has a lot of features:

  * Can use self-signed SSL certificates
  * Connect to tt-rss API behind HTTP Basic authentication
  * Separate and in-line article display mode
  * Switch between articles using volume buttons or swipes
  * Separate interfaces for tables and smartphones (properly supports Honeycomb devices, works on Froyo and up)
  * Mark above as read
  * Supports categories and labels
  * Offline mode with image caching
  * Backup settings to cloud automatically (Android 2.2+)
  * Respects background data setting for automatic updates
  * Feed search (requires API 2, tt-rss 1.5.9)
  * Add/remove labels from articles (online mode only)

The thing I like is the offline mode, which I enable before I leave to work. It
syncs at home, then in the train I can read all the new articles without an
internet connection. Furthermore it has all the features I use, starring and
sharing for example.

##### Things I like about it

  * It is fast
  * It runs on my server, without anybody serving me advertisements based on what I read
  * I have about 300 feeds in it, multiple categories, and it does not consume a lot of bandwidth or CPU time
  * the mobile client works on my phone (android 2.3), and also works good on my tablet (android 4.1). 
  * The android client has offline sync, very awesome.
  * Show unread only, filtering of feeds, not showing double articles
  * Unlimited users, unlimited feeds and unlimited labels/categories
  * Subscribe bookmarklet for every browser
  * You can link tiny tiny rss instances together
  * I can login with a client-side SSL certificate

##### Things I dont like

  * 2 factor authentication based on an SMS message is not avaialble

##### Compared to Google Reader

  * The only thing google reader has as an advantage over tiny tiny rss is 2 factor authentication via a phone call or text message. The rest of the features are all matched or better in tiny tiny RSS.
