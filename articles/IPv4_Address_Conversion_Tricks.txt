### Theory

Did you know that `http://3515693643/` is a valid link? Why? Because this is the
decimal form of the binary IP address. Normally we represent IP addresses as
10.0.0.1, 4 blocks of numbers. Those numbers are actually binary octets
represented in decimal, therefore they can never be more than 255. If we take
the whole binary number of all blocks, and convert that to base 10, we get a
result like above, which in turn is a working network address.

This "feature" is documented in the [inet_aton(3)][2] manpage.

I've written a little javascript based converter so you can try it out yourself.

### Example

Take the IP address `209.141.58.75`. As a binary octets that would be:
`1101000.11000110.10011101.001001011`. That whole number (without the dots),
converted back to decimal in turn is: `3515693643`.

And, that is a working network address:

    
    
    $  ping 3515693643
    PING 3515693643 (209.141.58.75): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 209.141.58.75: icmp_seq=0 ttl=47 time=180.208 ms
    64 bytes from 209.141.58.75: icmp_seq=1 ttl=47 time=197.890 ms
