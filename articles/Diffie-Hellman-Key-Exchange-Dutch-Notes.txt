Notities Diffie Hellman Key Exchange

Alice & Bob kiezen een priemgetal P en een getal N. Deze zijn publiek.

Alice kiest een getal A (Prive)

Bob kiest een getal B (Prive)

A & B delen geen factoren met P.

* * *

Alice berekent J = N^A (modulo P)

Bob berekent K = N^B (modulo P)

* * *

Alice stuurt J naar Bob (Publiek)

Bob stuurt K naar Alice (Publiek)

* * *

Alice berekent K^A (modulo P)

Bob berekent J^B (modulo P)

Deze 2 getallen zijn hetzelfde en kunnen worden gebruikt als sleutel of om een
symmetrische sleutel te versleutelen.

* * *

Voorbeeld:

P = 127  
N = 23  
A = 34  
B = 16

J = N^A (mod P)  
23^34 = 19895113660064588580108197261066338165074766609  
19895113660064588580108197261066338165074766609 (mod 127) = 115  
J = 115

K = N^B (mod P)  
23^16 = 6132610415680998648961  
6132610415680998648961 (mod 127) = 31  
K = 31

Geheim A = K^A (mod P)  
31^34 = 508507766528375922442969666478706045897328683433921  
508507766528375922442969666478706045897328683433921 (mod 127) = 120  
Geheim A = 120

Geheim B = J^B (mod P)  
115^16 = 935762087353668006738433837890625  
935762087353668006738433837890625 (mod 127) = 120  
Geheim B = 120

Geheim A == Geheim B
