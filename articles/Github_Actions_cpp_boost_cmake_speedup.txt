For a personal project I use Github for source code hosting and Github Actions
as an automated build and test tool. Github Actions compiles my `cmake` project
and runs all the unit tests on every commit. It also saves a build artifact, the
actual compiled program. By utilizing some dependency caching and make flags
I sped up the build process by 43% by caching the `apt install libboost1.65-dev` 
and giving `cmake` a `-j2` makeflag.

> The improvements to the build script show the faster build time

This article shows my simple setup to compile a C++ project with cmake and Boost 
on Github Actions. After compilation, it runs all the tests and uploads the 
compiled binary for download. For my one man project it's overkill, but when
collaborating or when builds take a long time on your own machine, it's great
to have an automated build / test system.

Do note that the build time decreased from 1 minute 48 seconds to 47 seconds for
a small C++ project. The percentage wise speedup is large, but probably you might 
find the title a bit clickbaity. The main focus of this article is to show how 
to build a simple C++ project with Boost included using github actions.

It also shows how to cache an `apt install` and how to provide `cmake` with
the `MAKEFLAGS` to utilize the two cores that the free github builder virtual 
machine has.

At work we use Gitlab CI for this and it cuts compilation time of the entire project
from 2 hours to 20 minutes due to humongous build servers running gitlab runners. 
A few different binaries are built for different arm architectures, the test suite 
is run, doxygen docs are generated, code style checks are done and static analysis
is done with Sonarqube, all from one source. With a team of developers this all 
gives an enormous speed increase in the process of reviewing code and not 
forgetting certain things.

I don't have my own gitlab server running (anymore) but I noticed that github
also have a feature like gitlab ci, but they call it Github Actions, and it's 
free for public projects, for private projects you get a limited amount of time,
but 2000 minutes is enough for me. 

### Simple cmake C++ project with Boost on Github Actions

If you host your source code on github, you can use Github Actions. Most of my 
personal projects follow [this simple cmake structure][2] which integrates well
with my preferred IDE, CLion by JetBrains. The structure also has unit tests 
with GoogleTest.

For Boost integration, [check my other article][3] on integrating that in the 
project setup. On Ubuntu you also need to install the development libraries:

    apt install libboost-dev-all

The Github linux virtual machine that will build the project does have most
C++ development tools installed (like `gcc` and the `build-essential` package) 
but boost is missing. In the file you write which specifies your build steps
you can also use `sudo` to install packages via `apt`, in our case `boost`.

#### Basic workflow

In the root folder of your project, create a folder for the workflow files for
github:

    mkdir -p .github/workflows

In that folder, create a `.yml` file for your workflow. My basic example to
run `cmake` and my unit test is listed below.

    name: build and run tests
    on:
      push:
        branches: [ master ]
      pull_request:
        branches: [ master ]
    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        # install dependencies
        - name: boost
          run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -yq libboost1.65-dev
        # build project
        - name: mkdir
          run: mkdir build
        - name: cmake build
          run: cmake -Bbuild -H.
        - name: cmake make
          run: cmake --build build/ --target all
        # run tests
        - name: run test 1
          run: build/tst/Example1_tst
        - name: run test 2
          run: build/tst/Example2_tst
        

If you commit and push, you should be able to look up the action on Github:

![github action][4]

That was easy wasn't is? A remote server builds your program and runs the unit
tests. If you would do this on your local workstation the steps would be a bit 
like:

    #build code
    cd to/project/folder
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    # run tests
    tst/Example1_tst
    tst/Example2_tst


#### Caching the apt install dependencies

In my case the `apt update && apt install libboost-1.65-dev` takes almost 15 
seconds. If you have more packages, this takes longer and its also run every
time, but almost never changes. So a bit of a waste of time and resources.


[This][5] post on Stackoverflow has an elaborate example on caching `apt` steps. 
My example is a simplified version. Replace this step in your workflow file:

    - name: boost
      run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -yq libboost1.65-dev

With the following piece of code:

    - name: Cache boost
      uses: actions/cache@v1.0.3
      id: cache-boost
      with:
        path: "~/boost"
        key: libboost1.65-dev
    - name: Install boost
      env:
        CACHE_HIT: ${{steps.cache-boost.outputs.cache-hit}}
      run: |
        if [[ "$CACHE_HIT" == 'true' ]]; then
          sudo cp --force --recursive ~/boost/* /
        else
          sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -yq libboost1.65-dev
          mkdir -p ~/boost
          for dep in libboost1.65-dev; do
              dpkg -L $dep | while IFS= read -r f; do if test -f $f; then echo $f; fi; done | xargs cp --parents --target-directory ~/boost/
          done
        fi


What this basically does is, if boost is not installed yet, install it and then
use `dpkg` to copy all newly installed files to a folder. The next time, the 
virtual machine will download that `artifact` and just extract it on `/`. The
effect is the same, the libraries are installed, however the time it takes is 
just 1 second instead of 15 seconds.

If you need to install a newer version of the package, say, `libboost-1.71-dev`,
replace the package name by the newer one and you're done.

If you have multiple packages to install, make sure they're the actual packages,
not a meta-package (a package without files, just dependencies). Meta-packages
don't have files to copy, so the steps will fail. You can use the Ubuntu or 
Debian packages site to check, for example [libboost-dev][6] is a meta-package
(10 kB package size, [no actual files][9]) where as [libboost1.71-dev][7] is an 
actual package. Larger file size and [lots of included files][8].

With this first improvement, subsequent build will be faster, especially when 
you have lots of dependencies to install. One more optimalisation we can do is
provide a `makeflag` to use more resources during building.

#### Provide makeflags to cmake

In a cmake project, the build steps can all be done using cmake itself instead
of the build system cmake generates for (like make/ninja), [if your cmake 
version is 3.15 or higher][10]):

    cd to/project/folder
    cmake --build build/
    sudo cmake --install build/

No seperate `make`, the last cmake command wraps around that. You can also just 
do it the old fashioned way:

    cd to/project/folder/build
    cmake ..
    make all
    sudo make install

Using the `cmake` commands works not only for `Makefiles`, but also for `ninja`
or any other build system `cmake` can generate.

But, in our example, we use `Makefiles` and to use [the two cores][11] the github
virtual machine has (instead of just one core) we must provide a flag to `make`.

If you would do it with the commandline you would do this:

    make -j2 all

Where `-j#` is the amount of cores you want to use to build. Now with cmake we 
can do more complicated things in our `CMakeLists.txt`, but that would clutter 
up our simple example. Github Actions allows you to set environment variables 
and `make` can use the `MAKEFLAGS` environment variable. If we set that to 
contain `-j2`, even via `cmake`, the flag will be passed through. 

In our github actions yaml file, replace the following step:


    - name: cmake make
      run: cmake --build build/ --target all

With the following code. You could also just add the last two lines instead 
of replacing the whole block.

    - name: cmake make
      run: cmake --build build/ --target all
      env:
        MAKEFLAGS: "-j2"

In my case using two cores sped up the build process by another 27 seconds. If 
your project is larger, the improvement will be bigger as well.

### Upload build artifacts

One of the other usefull features is to be able to download certain files that
were built. Github calls them `build artifacts` and you can download them via
the webpage:

![gh action download][12]

At work, via Gitlab, we use this to cross compile for a few different ARM 
architectures. Not everybody has a crosscompiler setup, but they can just 
download their freshly built binary and run it on actual hardware. Most of our
testing is automated with unit tests, but there are edge cases, for example,
interaction with actual hardware (think valves, pumps, high voltage relais).

If you don't crosscompile, it is still useful, it allows other people to get a 
binary without having to compile it. A tester could login, download the binary
for their specific feature branch and use it for testing.

Build artifacts are also reproducable. You can trigger a build of a branch from
6 months ago and get that binary, just as pristine as it was back then.

Add the following to the bottom of your yml file. The paths are for our example.

    # upload artifact, example binary
    - name: Upload Example binary
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
      with:
        name: upload binary
        path: build/src/Example

You can go crazy with this, couple it with github releases for certain branches 
and automate more, but that is out of scope for our example case.

#### The final yaml file

The yaml file with all improvements is listed below:

    name: build and run tests
    on:
      push:
        branches: [ master ]
      pull_request:
        branches: [ master ]
    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        # install and cache dependencies
        - name: Cache boost
          uses: actions/cache@v1.0.3
          id: cache-boost
          with:
            path: "~/boost"
            key: libboost1.65-dev
        - name: Install boost
          env:
            CACHE_HIT: ${{steps.cache-boost.outputs.cache-hit}}
          run: |
            if [[ "$CACHE_HIT" == 'true' ]]; then
              sudo cp --force --recursive ~/boost/* /
            else
              sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -yq libboost1.65-dev
              mkdir -p ~/boost
              for dep in libboost1.65-dev; do
                  dpkg -L $dep | while IFS= read -r f; do if test -f $f; then echo $f; fi; done | xargs cp --parents --target-directory ~/boost/
              done
            fi
        # build project
        - name: mkdir
          run: mkdir build
        - name: cmake build
          run: cmake -Bbuild -H.
        - name: cmake make
          run: cmake --build build/ --target all
          env:
            MAKEFLAGS: "-j2"
        # run tests
        - name: run test 1
          run: build/tst/Example1_tst
        - name: run test 2
          run: build/tst/Example2_tst
        # upload artifact, game binary
        - name: Upload Example binary
          uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1
          with:
            name: upload binary
            path: build/src/Example


### Conclusion

This article discussed both the automated build setup of a `C++` project on Github
actions, how to upload build artifacts and two improvements to speed up such a 
build. In my case the improvements are significant percentage wise, but not that 
impressive if you look at the actual numbers. In the case of larger projects, or 
when you are billed for runtime, the improvements could have a bigger effect.
