The POODLE bug is a new bug discovered by Google in the SSLv3 protocol. The fix
is easy, disable support for SSLv3. See <https://cipherli.st> for a good list of
SSL ciphers. You can use this check from the shell to check your servers.

This command can easily be automated with other shell scripts. It also allows
you to check your services without exposing them to an external checking
website.

See the google security blog for more info on the bug: .

### Fix POODLE

To fix the bug, disable SSLv3 and use a secure cipherlist. I've written a few
good tutorials about strong SSL security for different webservers. These
tutorials automatically fix POODLE because they disable SSLv3:

  * [See my tutorial for Apache][3]
  * [See my tutorial for nginx][4]
  * [See my tutorial for lighttpd][5]

Want an easy, very secure copy-pastable config for your webserver? Check out my
other project, <https://cipherli.st> for a good, secure config.

### TLS-FALLBACK-SCSV

Google have proposed an extension to SSL/TLS named [TLS _FALLBACK_ SCSV][6] that
seeks to prevent forced SSL downgrades. This is automatically enabled if you
upgrade OpenSSL to the following versions:

  * OpenSSL 1.0.1 has TLS _FALLBACK_ SCSV in 1.0.1j and higher.
  * OpenSSL 1.0.0 has TLS _FALLBACK_ SCSV in 1.0.0o and higher.
  * OpenSSL 0.9.8 has TLS _FALLBACK_ SCSV in 0.9.8zc and higher.

### Manual check

Use the following command to check an IP or hostname:

    
    
    echo | timeout 3 openssl s_client -connect HOSTNAMEORIPADDRESS:443 >/dev/null 2>&1; if [[ $? != 0 ]]; then echo "UNKNOWN: HOSTNAMEORIPADDRESS timeout or connection error"; else echo | openssl s_client -connect HOSTNAMEORIPADDRESS:443 -ssl3 2>&1 | grep -qo "sslv3 alert handshake failure\|SSL3_GET_RECORD:wrong version number" && echo "OK: HOSTNAMEORIPADDRESS Not vulnerable" || echo "FAIL:  HOSTNAMEORIPADDRESS vulnerable; sslv3 connection accepted"; fi
    

Replace HOSTNAMEORIPADDRESS by the actual hostname or IP address. If you use
SNI, add the `-servername actualhost.org` option to the 2 OpenSSL commands, like
so:

    
    
    openssl s_client -servername snihostname.org -connect 172.16.30.5:443 -ssl    
    

### Examples

#### Non-vulnerable website:

    
    
     echo | timeout 3 openssl s_client -connect raymii.org:443 >/dev/null 2>&1; if [[ $? != 0 ]]; then echo "UNKNOWN: raymii.org timeout or connection error"; else echo | openssl s_client -connect raymii.org:443 -ssl3 2>&1 | grep -qo "sslv3 alert handshake failure\|SSL3_GET_RECORD:wrong version number" && echo "OK: raymii.org Not vulnerable" || echo "FAIL:  raymii.org vulnerable; sslv3 connection accepted"; fi
    

Result:

    
    
    OK: raymii.org Not vulnerable
    

#### Vulnerable site:

    
    
    echo | timeout 3 openssl s_client -connect sslv3-testhost.com:443 >/dev/null 2>&1; if [[ $? != 0 ]]; then echo "UNKNOWN: sslv3-testhost.com timeout or connection error"; else echo | openssl s_client -connect sslv3-testhost.com:443 -ssl3 2>&1 | grep -qo "sslv3 alert handshake failure\|SSL3_GET_RECORD:wrong version number" && echo "OK: sslv3-testhost.com Not vulnerable" || echo "FAIL:  sslv3-testhost.com vulnerable; sslv3 connection accepted"; fi
    

Result:

    
    
    FAIL: sslv3-testhost.com vulnerable; sslv3 connection accepted
    

#### Site without SSL:

    
    
    echo | timeout 3 openssl s_client -connect pepermunt.net:443 >/dev/null 2>&1; if [[ $? != 0 ]]; then echo "UNKNOWN: pepermunt.net timeout or connection error"; else echo | openssl s_client -connect pepermunt.net:443 -ssl3 2>&1 | grep -qo "sslv3 alert handshake failure\|SSL3_GET_RECORD:wrong version number" && echo "OK: pepermunt.net Not vulnerable" || echo "FAIL:  pepermunt.net vulnerable; sslv3 connection accepted"; fi
    

Result:

    
    
    UNKNOWN: pepermunt.net timeout or connection error
    

You can check other ports by changing `443` to any other valid port.
